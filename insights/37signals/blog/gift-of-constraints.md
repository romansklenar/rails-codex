# The Gift of Constraints

Constraints drive quality by forcing real trade-offs.

## Core Insight

- Without constraints, developers will pursue perfection — "ask developers if they need to build the perfect interaction... of course they do!"
- Unlimited time and resources make decision-making harder, not easier
- Constraints make cost-consciousness necessary rather than aspirational

## Fixed Time, Variable Scope

- Deadlines are firm; feature scope adjusts to fit
- Forces early distinction between "must have" and "nice to have"
- Teams restate problems and simplify solutions under pressure

## Small Teams as a Constraint

- Deliberately small teams create natural scarcity
- Limited bandwidth forces prioritization — you cannot build everything
- No amount of coaching replaces real limitations in driving trade-offs

## Practical Application

- **Scope first, build second** — decide what to cut before implementation starts
- **Good enough over perfect** — constraints reveal when to stop polishing
- **Restate the problem** — a simpler framing often yields a simpler solution
- **Trust the constraint** — resist expanding scope when you hit a wall; the wall is the feature

# The Radiating Programmer

Push information outward proactively. Do not wait for others to pull it from you.

## Principle

- Information radiation replaces information extraction
- You control timing and content; stakeholders stay informed without meetings
- Invest 1-2 hours per week on communication — it prevents far more meeting hours

## What to Share

- Unexpected problems encountered and how you handled them
- Technical discoveries and debugging insights
- Scope decisions and trade-offs made
- Progress narrative — the story behind completion, not just percentages
- Decisions made with reasoning ("I'm going with X unless you tell me otherwise")

## How to Share

- **Regular check-ins** — bi-weekly minimum, async, written, company-visible
- **Progress updates** — high-level narrative combining status with context (e.g., Hill Charts)
- **Non-blocking decisions** — state your conclusion, invite feedback, proceed if none arrives
- **Batch at day's end** — avoid interrupting deep work; summarize once

## Non-Blocking Decisions

- Make the decision yourself while informing others about it
- Pattern: "I'm going with [decision] if you don't tell me otherwise"
- Prevents self-imposed blocking while enabling collaboration

## What This Replaces

- Status meetings that exist only to extract updates
- Synchronous ceremonies that could have been a written update
- Reserve meetings for discussions that written radiation cannot cover

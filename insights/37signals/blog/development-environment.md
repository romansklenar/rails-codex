# Development Environment

Productivity comes from the environment, not the programmer.

## Team Structure

- Teams of two people
- Hire self-driven individuals ("managers of one")
- Minimal management overhead

## Time Management

- Six-week development cycles with variable scope
- One recurring 1-hour meeting per week
- Asynchronous communication by default
- Nearly all time available for deep work

## Technical Practices

- Reuse existing patterns (concerns, delegated types) instead of reinventing
- Maintain working legacy code; only rewrite when practical value justifies it
- Use framework abstractions (Hotwire) over custom solutions

## Constraints as Features

- Time limits force clarity on what truly matters
- "Everything else can wait" — eliminate feature creep
- Scope decisions happen upfront, not during implementation

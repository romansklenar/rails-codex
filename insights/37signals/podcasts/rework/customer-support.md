# Customer & Support

## Support as a Core Practice

- Treat support as a product feature bundled with the software, not a cost center to minimize — "when you buy Basecamp, you buy us"
- Staff for 24-hour coverage using time-zone distribution (US, EU, APAC) rather than overnight shifts or on-call rotations
- Target a first-reply time of ~1 hour for standard requests; under a minute proved counterproductive (customers assumed they were talking to a bot)
- Provide an explicit "emergency" flag in-app so urgent issues surface immediately without abusing the queue
- Use case-study libraries for onboarding: document interactions that went well and ones that didn't, and walk new hires through them case by case in the first weeks
- Hire for good judgment, not just product knowledge — reps must make sound calls independently, without a supervisor on every exchange
- Rotate upset customers to a fresh teammate voice rather than escalating through tiers; a new human voice often resets the dynamic
- Write like you're explaining to a friend or family member, not a tech person — "train the corporate out of them"; strip jargon, avoid boilerplate apology phrases
- Never hide behind automated phone trees, bots, or help-doc links when a human conversation would serve the customer better
- Keep "Fisher Price easy" as the writing standard: short, clean answers beat comprehensive but dense ones

## Everyone on the Front Lines

- Every employee — designers, programmers, executives, founders — rotates through customer support (called "EOS," Everyone On Support)
- Direct customer contact removes the "muffler" that a support department creates: you hear the raw frustration, not a filtered summary
- Developers who do support often come away with 20-minute fixes they would never have prioritized through the formal feature-request pipeline
- Being on the front lines reminds each person why the company exists — customers are paying the paycheck, not just the founders
- Start small when implementing this in another company: find one willing person, shadow them the whole first day, then use that experience to train the next person
- Founders doing support is non-negotiable — if Jason or David won't do it, there's no credibility in requiring it of others
- EOS creates a mirror effect: DHH reports becoming embarrassed about his own past behavior as an impatient customer after spending a day answering support tickets
- Watching someone use your product in a demo or support session is more valuable than any usability report — you cringe at what you thought was obvious

## Handling Difficult Customers

- The "two tokens" rule: when there's conflict, one party takes "it's no big deal" and the other takes "it's the end of the world" — grab the big-deal token first so the customer can't
- Never recite terms of service back to an angry customer — if you feel compelled to cite policy, that is a signal the policy is wrong, not the customer
- Give customers grace and space: assume they're having a hard day for reasons entirely unrelated to your product
- Pause before replying when your first instinct is defensive — the authentic voice is fine, but not the knee-jerk version of it
- It's acceptable to pass a customer to a teammate if the email has hit you the wrong way before you've even replied; asking for help is a team strength
- Customers who have a problem resolved well rate a company higher than customers who had no problem at all — every support interaction is a marketing moment
- A personal follow-up (small gift, handwritten thank-you card) after a recovery moment creates lifetime brand advocates
- Phone or video calls, not just email, are a legitimate support channel — jump on a Zoom link when a customer needs real-time help

## Talking Directly to Customers

- Founders should send personal emails to customers from their own addresses, not on behalf of the company — "emailing me is emailing me; no assistant, no AI"
- A single personal email from a founder can surface feature requests that never would have surfaced through aggregate feedback pipelines — e.g., voice notes in Basecamp emerged this way
- Customers use different words for your features than you do; direct conversation is the only way to discover the gap between your language and theirs
- Sometimes customers request features you already have — direct conversation closes that knowledge gap instantly; no other channel does
- Customer-to-founder connection is harder to cancel than a software subscription; people will give more grace to a product when they trust the person behind it
- Email is now a high-effort channel, which is a signal: the people who write are serious enough that every one deserves a response
- Founders can also initiate: scan recent orders for recognizable names and reach out proactively — the relationship formed before the product arrives makes the product taste better
- A personal reply to a complaint — even one that doesn't grant the request — that includes an authentic apology and a change in process converts a detractor into an advocate

## Building a Customer Community

- The Basecamp Community lives inside Basecamp itself, seeded with real content (tips, guidelines, example posts, fake-user intro templates) before any member was invited — don't launch an empty room
- Start with 8–10 hand-picked "beta" members who will set the tone; roughly half of them will still be the most active contributors years later
- Treat the community host role like event hosting: invite people in, offer something to engage with, but step back and let members answer each other — intervene on a case-by-case basis
- Create dedicated spaces for peer knowledge-sharing (e.g., "Inspiration Exchange") where users post creative use-cases and workarounds, not just questions
- Bring in founder or product posts occasionally for high-engagement moments — a post from the CEO produces outsized reaction and signals that leadership is present
- Use the community for beta testing new features; give members early access and their feedback before wide release
- Run periodic surveys to cull initiatives that aren't getting engagement; cut ruthlessly rather than maintain things that take more effort than they return
- Lurkers are valid members — they learn, they don't cause harm, and they occasionally convert into contributors; don't gate the community behind forced participation
- Grow slowly and manually: 2,100 members after three years is a sign of health, not underperformance

## Customer Segmentation: Who to Serve

- Never let a single customer represent more than a small slice of revenue — if one cancellation could damage the business, the customer mix is wrong
- Enterprise customers change incentives: a $5,000/month customer (vs. $100) triggers an involuntary concierge reflex that distorts priorities and product direction
- Enterprise sales cycles (security questionnaires, legal review, negotiated pricing, account management) are incompatible with a self-serve product model — don't adopt them halfway
- Enterprise customers optimize software for procurement managers and lawyers, not users — that's why so much enterprise software is bad
- Design software for the people who must use it, not for the people who buy it; misaligning buyer and user corrupts product decisions over time
- The right question isn't "why wouldn't you want their money?" — it's "what does taking their money do to the kind of business you become?"
- A healthy customer base is a flat distribution: no outliers, every customer pays roughly the same, any random 10% can leave without crisis
- It's not a failure when a customer outgrows you — if they started as a 20-person team and are now 2,000, they need different software; let them go gracefully
- Don't build the features that only a fraction of large existing customers request; those requests, if fulfilled, price out the small new customers who represent your real market
- Trying to keep every customer at every size is itself a choice — one that silently kills the product for the customers you actually want

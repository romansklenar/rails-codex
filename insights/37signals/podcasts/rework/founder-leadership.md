# Founder & Leadership

## Stepping Back from Day-to-Day

- Gripping the organization too tight produces the same effect as gripping a drumstick too hard — less control, less range of motion, faster fatigue; loosening grip is how you get more out of it
- Founder presence in a thread changes the nature of that thread — people defer upward; just appearing in a room causes others to stop deciding
- At ~70 people there are hundreds of daily decisions you could referee; weighing in on 5–10 instead of 25 is the goal, not zero
- "If I step out and the whole thing falls apart, that's telling you something" — absentee founders and micromanaging founders are both failure modes
- The trigger for stepping back: when you feel like a bottleneck, you are one; being the biggest bottleneck is also the riskiest single point of failure
- A 5% slice of your attention is worse than 100% of a capable employee's attention — when you can't even hold a project in working memory, it belongs to someone else
- DHH is binary in his involvement — once he dips in he goes all in; knowing this, he deliberately avoids opening certain projects to prevent being pulled in
- The "I intend to" framework (from _Turn the Ship Around_): people state intention then act unless overridden, versus asking permission; puts ownership and learning on the person closest to the work
- Default to trusting people's execution; override is available but rarely needed — on the REWORK podcast itself, topic selection is fully delegated to the host

## Sabbaticals & Extended Time Off

- 37signals policy: 30-day paid sabbatical every three years, available to all employees regardless of role or seniority
- Jason took his first sabbatical after 23 years — the company ran fine; no decisions were held for his return, which is exactly how it should be
- DHH's "forced" sabbatical (7 weeks during Denmark move) produced the same insight: "the ship runs fine without us" — and this must be demonstrated, not just stated
- Six weeks is roughly the sweet spot: first 3–4 weeks are active decompression, the boredom phase (weeks 4–6) is the real recharging; by week 6–7 the itch to return is back
- Do not try to catch up on everything missed — just start fresh; what truly mattered will surface on its own within a week
- No decisions should be waiting for you when you return; anything requiring founder sign-off to proceed is a fragility signal
- Prep protocol: catch up 1:1 with 3–4 key collaborators, write a company-wide note ~1 month out, shift any active exploration work into production mode so others can carry it forward
- The organizational benefit is as important as the personal one — sabbaticals teach the company it is self-sufficient and eliminate "learned helplessness"
- For small businesses (under ~7 people), sabbaticals are harder; the policy becomes viable once you have enough slack in the system to absorb one absence

## Co-founder Partnership

- Jason and DHH worked together for nearly 4 years before formalizing any partnership — the low-risk path is to work with someone first, then decide; "no one would marry someone they met at a conference"
- Partnership origin: DHH answered a detailed forum post Jason made about a PHP pagination problem; quality of that response signaled something; led to client work, then Basecamp, then equity
- Key success factor: distinct domains with minimal collision — Jason owns product design, DHH owns technical architecture; they share the business philosophy layer in the middle
- Power-sharing must be explicit: knowing in advance who defers to whom on which domain removes the arm-wrestling dynamic from every disagreement
- Ownership structure matters — Jason owns more equity because he brought in brand equity and had run the company solo; this clarity prevented resentment
- The "expanding vs. narrowing" dynamic: Jason tends to expand options and experiments, DHH tends to narrow toward a decision; both functions are necessary and create productive tension
- No external investor pressure is a prerequisite for a stable founding partnership — investor-driven urgency forces founders into positions they'd never choose, creating fractures
- Without outside money, any individual mistake is bounded: "I can't think of a decision that, if Jason is really wrong, we're done" — low criticality enables trust over time
- After 23 years: the moving average is so long that no single disagreement can dent it; the default is now "let's see where it goes" rather than "I must win this"
- The operating agreement has been nearly unchanged for 20 years — a mark of alignment, not complacency
- Genuine admiration is load-bearing: if you privately believe you're pulling all the weight, that attitude will corrode any partnership regardless of complementary skills
- Accept that you can't fully explain why a long partnership works — post-hoc rationalizations ("great value overlap", "distinct domains") are useful frameworks but don't capture causation; humility about this is itself stabilizing
- Concrete example of trust overriding conviction: DHH was certain HEY should launch for businesses first; Jason pushed individuals first; DHH deferred; result was 30,000 signups vs. "crickets" for the business version — a visceral reminder to trust your partner's gut even when you disagree

## Finding and Vetting Co-founders

- Do not go looking for a co-founder in the abstract — put yourself in communities (open source, college, client work) where real working relationships form over time
- Speed-dating at a conference → equity split is a recipe for founders falling out; most early company failures stem from founder incompatibility, not product failure
- Look for someone who does something meaningfully different from you — two designers or two programmers will collide constantly over the same domain
- Shared business philosophy in the center matters more than matching skill sets; if you see the world differently on fundamentals (growth, money, pace), divergence is inevitable
- YC pushes co-founders because investor risk is mitigated when one founder leaves; that logic does not apply to bootstrapped companies
- Solo founding is viable; the missing value of a co-founder is cognitive diversity and someone to argue against, not just another pair of hands

## Succession & Founder Exit

- Neither Jason nor DHH envisions handing the company to new leadership — the most realistic exit path is a sale, followed by a clean separation
- Key reason: both founders' income comes from profit distributions, not salaries; a founder-in-the-background structure cannot work with that setup
- DHH is "uniquely ill-suited to sit in the passenger seat of any car I feel ownership of" — this character trait rules out a graceful handoff
- Family-run succession can work in traditional businesses; in software, there's almost no precedent for it working at the founder-led scale
- If sold: the new owners should have it "a million miles away" — any association with original founders would corrupt both parties' ability to act freely
- Trial runs with spin-offs and external investments have confirmed this: being partially out but still "on the hook" is the worst of both worlds

## Founder Accessibility & Staying Connected

- Jason answered every customer service email personally for the first three years — at peak, 150 emails per day; that input fed the product gut more than any analytics dashboard
- "What else am I supposed to be doing?" — direct customer and community contact is the job, not a distraction from it
- A short response sent quickly is better than a perfect response sent never; the long email backlog is caused by guilt about short replies, not by volume
- Long sales cycles are real: people followed 37signals since 2005 and signed up for Basecamp or HEY 15 years later — staying visible compounds
- The product is inseparable from the founders' worldview — people who interact with the ideas for years eventually become customers; that requires the founders to remain visible and opinionated

## Founder Presence: Public Speaking & Conferences

- Live speaking is one of the few contexts where you have someone's full attention — no multi-tab browsing, no five-second skip; the scarcity of that attention makes in-person worth the travel cost
- Both Jason and DHH dropped in-person speaking for years during/after Covid; once re-engaged, both concluded "a few times a year" is the right cadence — not never, not the conference circuit treadmill
- The constraint Jason uses: stay within the same time zone; cross-timezone travel for a talk is not worth it at this stage of life — plenty of west-coast opportunities without flying to New York
- DHH's recovery heuristic: he needs recovery time after each event before the urge to say yes re-opens; don't commit to the next thing while still in recovery from the last
- Conferences recharge faith in your community in ways social media actively destroys — in-person you don't encounter the weaponized negativity that Twitter optimizes for; that recharge is medicinal, not optional
- Physical touch — a handshake — literally opens minds to counter-arguments in a way that no Twitter thread can; in-person disagreements almost never reach the toxicity floor of the average social media exchange
- "You're shorter than I thought, and you're nicer than I thought" — showing up in person corrects false impressions formed from 140-character opinions; founders with polarizing public personas especially benefit from this humanizing effect
- DHH's framework for conferences as an introvert: treat it like a race or a heavy workout — you know going in you won't enjoy every moment, but the long-term return (social capacity, community connection) justifies the discomfort; "obstacle is the way"
- Conference talks are more about how you make people feel than what you say — attendees leave Rails World with a sense that the community is vibrant and exciting, not primarily with a list of new APIs; engineer the feeling, not just the content
- For aspiring speakers: the teaching-forces-learning loop — speaking at a conference forces you to distill material to its fundamentals in a way that private thinking never does; the preparation stress is the point, not a side effect
- DHH's public speaking preference: walk in cold with no pre-discussed topics and freestyle — he consistently produces better material that way than from written-out keynotes; Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams" was the first take and three days of re-recording couldn't beat it
- Jason's rule: never read interview questions in advance; wanting to know what you'll be asked is the desire to recite rather than to think; "people can smell the script" — scripted delivery signals inauthenticity even when the underlying ideas are good
- Authenticity beats polish: the best public speakers Jason has seen (Gary Vaynerchuk, Jim Rohn) are compelling because they are unmistakably themselves on stage, not because they are technically flawless
- For keynotes with concrete new material (new frameworks, shipped products), preparation is manageable; for abstract thesis talks, scripting becomes homework that makes DHH nervous rather than confident — avoid grand abstractions in favor of concrete, already-shipped things
- Start small: speaking skill is acquired through reps; early clips of now-famous speakers are often cringe-worthy; the only path to good is to do it badly in smaller venues first, then work up

## Product Portfolio Pruning

- The KonMari question applied to product decisions: "does this product spark joy?" — DHH and Jason read Marie Kondo's book together and immediately identified products that weren't sparking joy; it directly led to selling We Work Remotely and stopping active development of Highrise
- Thanking a product for what it contributed before retiring it is not sentimentality — it's a framework for overcoming the sunk-cost guilt that causes founders to keep zombie products alive; Highrise ran for 12 years, made millions, served customers well; "that's an incredible run"
- The KonMari method applied to software: you can let go of code the same way you let go of camera gear you haven't used — "if you let things out, they can go fulfill their potential elsewhere"
- YAGNI and KonMari share the same root: both say "if you haven't used this thing, the assumption that you'll need it later is almost always wrong; let it go and trust you can bring it back if you were wrong"
- "Do I want to take this into the future with me?" — this framing works for product roadmap items, code, features, book chapters, and podcast edits equally; the 37signals books started at twice their published length and were cut by half using the same question
- Mass is the enemy: holding onto products you don't love actively prevents you from focusing creative energy on what you do love; killing is not giving up, it's making room
- Trying to sell a product (Highrise spin-off attempts) and finding it harder than expected is itself useful data — it taught Jason and DHH what they do and don't want to take on in future portfolio decisions; "even those twists and turns taught us something"

## Ignoring the "Real World" Skeptics

- "That would never work in the real world" is a defensive rationalization, not an analytical claim; it protects the speaker from having to examine their own assumptions
- Every unorthodox practice at 37signals — remote work, no salespeople, no advertising, no meetings — was dismissed as real-world-incompatible before being proven otherwise
- Taking a risk is not the same as putting yourself at risk; you can swing for things without setting up the company so that one miss ends everything
- When incumbents have monopoly position, risk only has downside; newcomers must take risk to disrupt — "if we're just going to build what Gmail does, we can't beat Gmail"
- Being "weird" is a deliberate directive: HEY was explicitly required to look nothing like Gmail or Outlook; differentiation from incumbents is the strategy, not a side effect
- The motivation to prove skeptics wrong is a legitimate creative fuel — Ruby on Rails was built in part because people said exotic programming languages from Japan couldn't work in the enterprise

## Learning: Successes, Not Failures

- "Fail early, fail often" is a Silicon Valley heuristic suited to VC portfolio math — it does not apply to founders spending their own money and time
- You learn more from successes than from failures: failure tells you one thing not to do, from a billion possible directions; success tells you something worth trying again
- Retrospectives on software projects are mostly useless — the lessons from going through the work are already internalized; the gut has been trained; articulating them in a two-hour meeting adds almost nothing
- Retrospectives work for repeatable, measurable processes (database migrations, outage reviews) not for creative product work where every output is different
- Campfire launched in 2005 and didn't take off; Slack launched the same product 10 years later and dominated — "learning" that chat-first didn't work would have been the wrong lesson
- The real learning happens during the work, not in the debrief: those weeks or months are the training data; your intuition is already updated before you sit down to discuss it
- Analogy to AI model weights: a good product person can't fully articulate why a decision is right any more than a language model can explain its next token — the wisdom is in the weights, not in a list of conclusions
- You can't achieve second-order learning from retrospective notes either — reading someone else's compiled lessons from a project you didn't work on transfers essentially nothing
- The right error rate: if you're not wrong, badly, at least 10% of the time, you're not deciding fast enough; the majority of decisions are reversible, so speed and willingness to be wrong are features, not recklessness
- Data analysts at 37signals produced months of rigorous analysis that concluded "people convert when they get others to use it with them" — obvious, and barely actionable; the full-time analyst role generates full-time analysis work that rarely improves decisions
- Every decision is ultimately a judgment call; even ostensibly "data-driven" companies hire executives for experience (accumulated human intuition), not for spreadsheet fluency — just admit it

## Lean Org Design for Founders

- No dedicated project managers, no middle management, no data scientists, no in-house legal, no salespeople — every role that exists must have concrete, non-fuzzy work to do from day one
- Middle management creates its own work and pulls everyone else into it; without it, the rest of the company becomes more capable, not less
- Standard team size for new features: one designer + one programmer; this team takes a pitch all the way to production with no handoffs
- Designers write their own HTML/CSS/JavaScript — the "design engineer" role is a symptom of skills atrophying at large companies
- Write job postings with 5–8 concrete projects the person could have worked on in the past month; if you can't write that list, you're not ready to hire
- Speculative hires (COO, data scientist, in-house lawyer) created work that pulled the whole company in; removing those roles made everyone more capable
- Start as small as you can for as long as you can; new companies' biggest advantage is having no legacy and no baggage — squandering that by mimicking larger companies' structures is a mistake
- Two-person teams work because there is no translation layer — not just no human middleman, but no technical handoff layer either; designers work directly in the same HTML/CSS/Ruby codebase as programmers
- Management at 37signals is by process, not by person: automated weekly check-ins ("what are you working on this week?", "what did you work on today?") replace daily standups and manager nagging; the six-week cycle clock is the oversight mechanism
- Product management dosing: one PM for six active teams across two major products is sufficient — "it's like food coloring, one drop turns the whole glass red; you don't need a gallon"
- Two-week scrum sprints produce nothing shippable — they're artificial bites of a real thing that accumulate as half-done work behind feature flags; 37signals' six-week cycle ends with something live and complete, then moves on
- Promise-driven growth is the root cause of bloated teams: far-future roadmap commitments force premature hiring, which requires more promises, which requires more hiring — break the loop by committing to nothing beyond the current cycle
- Single-person roles have a morale expiration date of roughly two years; people need someone who understands the actual work, not just a manager — this is a legitimate hiring trigger independent of workload
- Redundancy becomes a valid hiring reason once the business is solidly established: the "bus factor" of one person in a critical function (finance, QA) is prudent to resolve at maturity, but this logic does not apply early
- Invest in long-term employees as the internal version of "focus on what won't change" — customer support staff with 10+ years of tenure can make wide decisions on the spot; high turnover in support is a direct product of treating it as a cost center

## AI & the Evolving Founder Toolkit

- DHH's shift on AI: autocomplete mode interfered with his thinking process; agentic mode (running in terminal, executing independently from a plan) is compatible with his workflow
- The ratio that matters: how often does the agent produce something worth keeping vs. make a mess? In late 2025 that ratio crossed the threshold from "promising" to "actually useful"
- 80% done by an agent is valuable even if you rewrite the last 20% — seeing working software changes how you think about the problem
- Internal applications of AI at 37signals before product features: security report triage (HackerOne), production console access reviews, on-call performance investigation — all are toil-reduction use cases with clear signal/noise problems
- Don't ship AI features that add an "AI sticker" without being unambiguously better; being later to market with something customers will actually value is better than shipping slop to check a box
- Non-programmers get proportionally more out of AI than expert programmers do — the programmer knows they could do it; the non-programmer gets access to something that didn't exist for them before

## Naming Products

- A name is fuel: Jason does not start building until a name feels right — "if I can't find a name for something early, it's a sign something's missing"; the name is what you grab onto and pull yourself forward with
- Names follow the product's evolution: Fizzy started as Splat (bug tracker with windshield imagery), changed to Fizzy when the shapes became bubbles, briefly became Boxcar when the UI became cards — the name should track the actual product, not the original concept
- Conceptual tightness loses to phonetics: Boxcar had a richer conceptual story; Fizzy won because it's more pleasant to say and better fits the product's personality — prefer a name that sounds good over one that requires explanation
- Basecamp is the ideal: name, iconography, and concept all converge perfectly; you won't always be that lucky — don't hold out for perfection
- The banner matters for internal morale, not just marketing: "if your banner looks shit, who's going to want to charge up the hill for that?" — team enthusiasm for a name is a real signal
- The clean .com domain is overrated: basecamphq.com, backpackit.com, campfirenow.com were the original domains for years; the name came first; the domain was acquired later when the business could afford it
- Names acquire meaning through success, not the reverse: Instagram, Slack, WhatsApp, Yahoo — none would survive an internal rename proposal 10 years in; early-stage names are a product of the moment and don't need to be defensible by committee logic
- For open source, DHH favors invented words with a preferred pronunciation even if the letters don't warrant it: Omarchy (not "Omaki"), Kamal — the creator gets to decide how it sounds

## Beginner's Mind & Protecting Ignorance

- The greatest gift of being new is having no legacy and no baggage; most startups squander it immediately by inheriting other companies' complexity, processes, and structures
- Working on an existing product is cognitively tainted — you cannot clear prior design history from your head no matter how hard you try; every revision is colored by what existed before; new founders have a precious window of uncontaminated thinking they should protect as long as possible
- Embrace ignorance as a creative asset: DHH and Jason benefited enormously from not having 50 startup podcasts pre-programming their assumptions in 2001; that contamination is now near-unavoidable and requires deliberate effort to resist
- "What would I tell my 21-year-old self?" — keep your mouth shut; revealing the outcome spoils the journey; the novelty of discovering things for the first time is irreplaceable
- The overabundance of other people's opinions (Twitter, podcasts, reviews, box office results) is a destruction of self — you get pre-programmed before you form your own view; the deliberate cultivation of "not knowing what everyone else thinks" is a competitive advantage for founders
- If building from scratch today: keep it as simple and as small as possible for as long as possible; resist adopting best practices from elsewhere that lock you into a path before you've found your own way
- The company structure follows the same logic: an LLC that worked at 4 people still works at 60 people 25 years in; complexity is always a choice, not an inevitability — don't add it until you genuinely need it, because you can't easily remove it once it's there
- Deliberate beginner practice outside your domain sharpens the expert mind — learning chess, woodworking, magic, or salsa as an adult forces you to inhabit genuine ignorance, which is the same cognitive state early-stage founders must protect and which experienced founders tend to lose; the skill acquired is secondary to re-learning how to learn
- Flow (Csikszentmihalyi) is the goal in work and in skill acquisition: a challenge just slightly harder than current capability, matched with a real shot at success — structuring projects and product cycles to maintain this optimal band prevents both boredom (too easy) and demoralization (too hard); chess ratings and six-week cycles are both implementations of the same principle
- Peer learning within a community of shared interest is faster than private study — surrounding yourself with people who are slightly better and slightly worse and all looking in the same direction (not at each other) produces faster improvement than solitary practice; open source communities and skill clubs are structurally identical in this respect
- Practice over theory, always — reading a library about how to build a table is not equivalent to building a crummy table; the lesson from the crummy table is already internalized before you sit down to read; put yourself in the arena first, then the theory makes sense; the same applies to product work
- Make an external commitment before you start — telling people "I'm going to climb that mountain in France at the end of this year" is more binding than a private goal; public accountability changes the motivational calculus and creates a natural deadline; whether you meet it exactly is less important than what you built toward it
- The internal voice saying "you look like a beginner" is the only real obstacle — most social fear of being seen as a novice is self-generated, not external; recognizing it as internal lets you choose which voice to feed: the doubtful one or the one that's genuinely excited to get better

## Quitting as a Leadership Act

- **Founders must model quitting**: when the natural human default is to double down on sunk cost, the people with formal authority must be the ones who visibly walk away first; if Jason and David never quit anything, teams will not feel safe doing it either
- **Quitting needs active celebration, not just permission**: the organizational default is to reward people who push through — to correct this, quitting a project that genuinely revealed new information and informed a better path deserves explicit positive recognition, not just silence; celebration counteracts the sunk-cost instinct at the cultural level
- **Quitting and personal failure are different things**: the psychological temptation to equate stopping a project with personal inadequacy ("I couldn't do it") is the main reason people don't quit; the organization can short-circuit this by clearly separating the quality of work from the decision to stop — good work that was too expensive to ship is not a failure of the person who did it
- **Quitting has tiers of blameworthiness**: quitting because genuinely unforeseeable information emerged is a success of judgment; quitting because a foreseeable problem was ignored deserves a small "pinch" of honest reflection without escalating it to the label of failure; the distinction matters for learning without recrimination
- **Preserving the reality of the cycle boundary**: if a six-week deadline is always extended when a project is close, the boundary is fiction; founders occasionally quitting a project that is nearly done — precisely because it is nearly done — is what proves to the team that the boundary is real and the rules apply equally
- Quitting reinforces that momentum is not the same as progress: the fact that a team has been working on something for weeks creates its own gravitational pull toward completion; leaders who can interrupt that pull when the decision calculus changes are the ones who keep organisations from spending good time after bad

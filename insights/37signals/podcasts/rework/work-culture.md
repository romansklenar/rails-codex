# Work Culture & Time

## Work-Life Balance

- 40 hours is the hard ceiling, not a soft guideline — 37signals treats it as a commitment, not an aspiration; overtime is a scope failure, not a work-ethic badge
- The 8-8-8 formula: eight hours of sleep, eight hours of work, eight hours of personal time — violating any of them degrades the other two
- Basecamp was built on 10 hours/week as a side project, proving the correlation between hours and output is largely myth; prioritization matters more than raw time
- When someone works weekends, managers actively tell them to stop — it is treated as a failure mode of the organization, not a sign of dedication
- Unlimited vacation causes people to take *less* time off due to ambiguity about acceptable limits; 37signals switched to defined paid vacation plus a mandatory 30-day paid sabbatical every three years
- The sabbatical originated from one employee who needed a genuine long break; it became company policy after the result was demonstrably positive — policy from evidence, not ideology
- Occasional intense sprints are allowed and even healthy; the rule is that crunch must be rare (1–2 times per year, capped at 1–2 weeks) and followed by genuine recovery
- Leaders model the norm: DHH and Jason publicly track what they work on via check-ins, shut down at the end of the day, and don't send weekend messages
- Productivity is assessed by the quality and movement of work, not hours logged — no commit counts, story points, or time-tracking tools
- Burnout is treated as a design bug: if someone is consistently overworked, the system (scope, expectations, team size) is broken, not the person

## Remote Work

- 37signals is fully remote with no office — remote is not a perk or an experiment; it is the operating model and has been for 20+ years
- Overlap hours are non-negotiable for product teams: a minimum of 3–4 hours of real-time overlap per day is required; Chicago–Australia pairings have been tried and fail
- Remote pay matches San Francisco rates regardless of employee location — not done to save money, done to maintain quality and avoid creating a two-tier workforce
- Two in-person company meetups per year serve as the human recharge; meeting in person twice a year is enough to sustain real working relationships across the full year
- The pandemic failure mode was not remote work — it was porting an office meeting schedule onto Zoom; Zoom fatigue is a meeting-culture problem, not a remote-work problem
- Asynchronous communication is the default; synchronous (calls, video) is reserved for breaking stalemates, reviewing shared work, or genuine social time
- Hybrid models where most staff are in-office and a minority are remote tend to disadvantage remote workers in career visibility; 37signals prefers pure remote for product teams
- New employees face the steepest challenge in remote settings — time-zone pairing and onboarding need extra care when someone is both new and distributed
- Remote work removes natural friction on after-hours work: managers actively watch for people checking in early, late, and on weekends as a warning signal
- Culture travel follows the person: designers at 37signals have lived in 20+ cities in a year with no disruption to the team — remote done right enables that kind of personal freedom

## Meetings & Interruptions

- A one-hour meeting with five people costs five work-hours, not one — this is the first math most organizations never do when scheduling meetings
- Meetings should be the last resort, not the first reflex: try writing it up, try an async discussion thread, then call a meeting only if those fail or a stalemate emerges
- 37signals has no shared calendars — you cannot put something on another person's calendar without asking; this friction is intentional and protective
- The problem is not just time but attention: two 30-minute meetings in a day can hollow out the productive capacity of the entire day because the mind cannot fully engage knowing an interruption is coming
- Jason's scheduling rule: Mondays and Fridays are kept clear of all commitments; David uses alternate-week blocking for heavy obligations
- Automatic check-ins in Basecamp replace status meetings entirely: "What are you going to work on this week?" (Monday) and "What did you work on today?" (end of day, answered 2–3x per week) are asked by the system, not by a manager
- Check-ins are written in each person's own words, not auto-summarized — the narrative quality makes it easy to spot when someone is struggling or drifting
- DHH can scan 40 check-ins in under five minutes; attending 40 status meetings would consume the full day — this is the core productivity multiplier
- Standing meetings at 37signals are optional and mostly social: design team weekly call, all-hands every 6–8 weeks at cycle end — attendance is pull-based, not mandatory
- Chat is not the solution: Slack-style tools replicate real-time interruption but with zero friction to blast 50 or 100 people simultaneously — the blast radius grows with team size
- Six-week cycles are the organizational-level bucket: priorities do not change mid-cycle; interruptions from new ideas are deferred to the next betting table

## Company Culture

- Culture is a moving average of daily actions, not a written statement — the last 50 days of actual behavior are the culture; handbooks and mission statements are only valid if the behavior matches
- Writing down a culture that does not exist in practice is actively harmful: it creates distrust faster than silence would
- No full-time managers — every manager at 37signals does it as a part-time role alongside doing real work; at ~60 people, the company found that having professional managers made it less capable, not more
- The management layer that does exist: each lead or principal programmer mentors one person; the ratio keeps the relationship substantive and keeps managers in the actual work
- Status updates are automated (check-ins), not managed — this eliminates the primary reason most companies need full-time managers
- Trust is the operating default: employees have a company credit card with the policy "spend it wisely"; permission structures and approval chains are treated as failures of hiring or culture, not safety mechanisms
- Policies should not be written in response to single incidents — creating a policy because one person did something wrong punishes everyone else forever; have the individual conversation instead
- Transparency is practiced, not declared: product direction, design-in-progress, code walkthroughs, and internal debates are shared publicly because sharing builds both audience and culture
- Simplicity over sophistication — bespoke internal tooling, complex processes, and feature bloat are all treated as signs of drift, not progress; the courage to stay basic is a competitive advantage
- Career progression does not require becoming a manager — individual contributors can advance to senior, lead, and principal as pure IC roles; the Peter Principle trap of promoting great engineers into unwanted management is explicitly avoided

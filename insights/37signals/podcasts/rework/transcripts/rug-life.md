# Rug life

**(00:00:00)** [Music plays]

**Shaun:** REWORK is brought to you by Basecamp. Have you ever had a group working on something where some people were using text messages, some were sending out email after email, and some were even dropping sticky notes on your desk with tasks on them? It's a mess and easy to get lost. Basecamp puts all your internal communication in one place so nothing gets lost and you can hold everyone accountable.

**Wailin:** This story starts with a tweet. Actually, it starts with a couple of rugs.

**Irin:** My name is Irin Carmon. I am a senior correspondent at New York Magazine. My grandfather was from Morocco and I was actually on assignment writing about where he's from and purchased a couple rugs at the Marrakesh market.

**Wailin:** Irin found a recommendation on a neighborhood Facebook group for J.L. Carpet & Upholstery. The owner picked up her Moroccan rugs and impressed her with his expertise and customer service approach.

**Irin:** He immediately knew exactly what kind of rugs they were. Business people aren't usually telling you how to use less of their services…

**Wailin:** But what really stood out was his dedication. Irin tweeted: "Just here to share that the representative from the rug cleaning service had 'Rug Life' tattooed across his knuckles."

**Jarred:** My name is Jarred Lustgarten and I own J.L. Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning as well as New York Rug Life.

**Wailin:** Today on the show, how Jarred left Wall Street to build a profitable rug cleaning business over a decade.

**Jarred:** I started the business about maybe 10 years ago. I had been working in finance. The last job that I had, I was a prop trader and I was trading some gold options and it didn't end well and I got blown out. And I looked on Craigslist. I was like, I need to just kind of turn my brain off for about six months or whatever.

**Jarred:** Within a couple of months I basically turned in my equipment. I borrowed $600 from my dad to buy a used machine, because I was very close to moving back home. At the time I was a single father, I had an 8-year-old kid with me, my son.

**Jarred:** My best friend at the time was a tattooer. He made some pink fliers for me and I spent all the money I had on one gallon of soap and a button-down shirt with my name stitched in it and I went out and started handing out fliers.

**Wailin:** Do you remember your first customer or what it was like to get those first couple of phone calls?

**Jarred:** This was so long ago that I didn't have a Blackberry or anything. I had a regular flip phone. I remember like, you're driving around the phone rings. And I would just light up, like, oh my God, the phone's ringing, the phone's ringing. And then somebody would be on the other end. And they'd tell me their tale of woe. I would be nervous to give them the price. So I'd say, like, $75.

**Jarred:** What separates me from the other people is the experience that we provide. Even when people look up my reviews online, it's 90% about their experience. We called, they answered. The quote was reasonable. The person showed up on time.

**Wailin:** How did you figure out what to charge, especially at the beginning?

**Jarred:** I was going on initially what the cheaper company I used to work for, kind of what they were charging. And then I was in a client's home and this was in the way beginning. After I was finished, and she was so happy, this lady in Park Slope where my business really started taking off before I went city-wide. She looked at me, and she was like, Jarred, you need to charge more money than this.

**Wailin:** In the beginning, it was just you, right? So how many jobs could you handle in a day?

**Jarred:** In the beginning I could maybe handle three jobs in one day. And even now, like, we stick to that model. We're like, okay, we only do three stops in a day, no matter what. That way, we don't have to compromise time for anybody's appointments.

**Wailin:** Did you have to do a lot of on-the-job learning? Did you encounter certain kinds of jobs or situations that you hadn't seen before?

**Jarred:** Yeah, like, I had a friend of mine that he had a laundromat. And he gave me a couple of tips because he bought the laundromat from carpet-cleaning money from a business that he had many years ago. One day I was looking at this fabric and I turned a whole sage green couch pink in one day. I was like, oh my God. I went back to the customer and when they called me, I said, listen, I'll do whatever it takes to make it right.

**Wailin:** After you started taking these classes and learning more, did you ever figure out what happened with that green couch that turned pink?

**Jarred:** Yes. Many, many years ago, they made this law where they have to put a flame retardant inside a cushion that has any feathers. Many times, it's like a pinkish or red color and it's inside the cushion. Over time, it will wick all the way to the top where the fabric is, especially after it gets wet.

**Wailin:** It sounds like your job involves a fair amount of detective work, right?

**Jarred:** Absolutely, yes. There's so many variables involved. The main variable, oddly enough, is the customer. Because the customer will tell you, I didn't touch this. But normally the original sin is okay, but once people go in a panic, they go underneath the sink and they get the Resolve, the OxyClean, the this, the that. They make a big sandwich and that's typically where the problems lie.

**Wailin:** What are the most difficult kinds of stains to get out?

**Jarred:** Okay, keeping it all the way 100, the worst thing is those little icees that the kids get in the summer time that are like neon green and blue and red, those 50 cent icees. It's over. I don't know what chemical that is that they're making money off of selling them for 50 cents.

**Jarred:** When that gets on the rug, on the couch, it's over. Because think about it this way, there are dyes that are in the food, they're either natural dyes like grapes, with wine. And then there's synthetic dyes like Snapple apple has red dye number 5.

**Wailin:** That's interesting, the service you offer being able to color-correct a rug. That sounds like something you would have added later on as you got more specialized.

**Jarred:** Absolutely. My mentor, Lisa Wagner, the lady who took pity on me, planted the seed of, if you just specialize in one or two niches and become an expert, you can charge a premium.

**Wailin:** When did you get to the point where you felt this business would be sustainable?

**Jarred:** Here's what happened. In the very beginning, I said to myself, I'm going to go to community college at night. I went for an LPN which is a lower level nurse. But within six months I was going so hard at getting jobs that I dropped out of that school and that was it. Because I knew, this has to be everything. You should never start a business unless you absolutely have to.

**Jarred:** If I didn't close jobs or I didn't get customers, the lights were going to get turned off. And there were times when we were swapping the ConEd bill and the cable bill and then the cable went away. I was blessed with the gift of desperation.

**Wailin:** Did your business grow especially at the beginning via word of mouth?

**Jarred:** In New York, and I'm sure now, everywhere else throughout the country, there are online communities of parents. A big one in New York is called Park Slope Parents. There was thousands of members and whatever. So one mom would be like, listen this guy just came and he took our rugs and he cleaned them and brought them back when he said he was supposed to and everything looks great.

**Wailin:** Are they a fairly demanding profile of client as well?

**Jarred:** They're people that they're in the fight, just like you. They don't want bullshit. What really starting separating us from other people initially was that like, yes. We do give exact time appointments. From the time I started my business until now.

**Jarred:** There's also a lot of bait and switch in our business. They'll say, okay, we'll come clean your couch for $99. And they get there and they put on a show and it's like, now it's going to be $300. When I say, okay, this is the price. They're so happy that this is the price.

**Jarred:** We clean probably 100 couches a month without blinking and maybe that amount of rugs as well. Maybe 100, 150 rugs a month. It's a mathematical equation that we're going to have to go and touch something up.

**Jarred:** When people called and they'd say, Jarred, this cushion, it dried a little funny. We were like, okay, no problem. We'll be there tomorrow. And they're like, really? Yeah. We'll be there tomorrow, don't worry. Obviously there's no charge.

**Wailin:** When did you get your tattoo?

**Jarred:** The Rug Life tattoo I got a year and a half ago. I've wanted for a while and I was saying to myself, once you do this it's over. It's over. I mean, I have another small tattoo on my neck behind my ear. It's a New York Yankee tattoo.

**Jarred:** That was very symbolic, too, because I got that maybe a year and a half into my business when my Series 7 was expiring from working on Wall Street. I said once this expires, I'm going to put this tattoo on my neck. That means I could never go back. I could never put a suit on again and have these people at J.P. Morgan or whatever tell me what to do. I'm going to be free.

**Jarred:** So a year and a half ago, I was looking at my hands and I was dreaming about it, Rug Life. I was so happy I did it. I close more deals with that tattoo than anything else I've done. Now when I pick up rugs, can people see that. They're like, oh my God, we have the right guy.

**Wailin:** What is going to be the specialty of Rug Life, the business within a business that you started?

**Jarred:** Everybody, they typically say the same thing. Like, all right, it's $200 to clean the couch but I have this mattress, I have this rug. You start tallying everything up and okay, this is going to be $1300, and they're like, oh my God, that's a lot of money. And we understand.

**Jarred:** We're going to go and we're going to sell these packages. So we come into the home, and we'll clean $1000 or more worth of stuff but we allow the customer to pay over time. You can make three payments. That really helps out a lot of people.

**Jarred:** Our Rug Life brand is specifically only going to sell those packages and then my J.L. Carpet brand is still you can buy things a la carte.

**Jarred:** The times that I've explained it to people, like, oh my God, that's a fantastic idea. But what if they cancel their credit card after the second payment or whatever. And this is really where we do it on the honor system. I'm willing to take the risk because I believe in humanity.

**Wailin:** When you think back to your life in finance, does it feel like a whole other life?

**Jarred:** Absolutely. But I would never be where I'm at without that experience. I was like, 17 or 18 years old and my first job, I was a runner on the New York Mercantile Exchange. There were thousands of people and you're just running around with tickets and all these other things and I learned a lot about punctuality.

**Jarred:** My next step, when I become a retail stockbroker on the telephone. These guys, they were like, it was unbelievable. Relentless, relentless, relentless. The reason why we make all this money here is because we just stay on the phone.

**Jarred:** So all of these things are that the seeds they really planted but the most important thing that stayed with me, working the numbers. So I knew when I was standing out on the corner with those pink fliers. Whether it was 100 or 1,000, it didn't matter. The number was going to come when the phone was gonna ring.

**Wailin:** What do you think about when you're cleaning a rug? It seems like it's very solitary alone-time, meditative work?

**Jarred:** It's funny that you say that because that's literally, it's like break-time from reality. My shop is off the beaten path. So I can go in there. I can be with myself, by myself. I listen to audio books. Podcasts. My hands do the magic and my brain is absorbing information.

**Jarred:** I wash three or four rugs and I come out of there and magically the world gets their act together. Nobody bothers me anymore, the lights are green and I'm a lot less agitated.

**Jarred:** What I'm really happy about is the richness that I have in my life. Our business does very well. We're profitable and all these other things, and the best thing about owning a business is it allows you to say, okay, who do I want to be? I have this freedom now.

**Jarred:** So the best thing that I could do was provide a place for my kids to come and work so they could follow their dreams. There's no contract that I could sign with somebody for doing this amount of work or whatever that is worth my joy.

**Jarred:** Can I provide good experience for my children? Yes. Can I relatively eat whatever I want in New York City, whenever I want? Absolutely, yes. And that's a big thing for me because I'm a huge foodie. I can go to the gym whenever I want. It's like, my time.

**Jarred:** Working a business is about buying back your own time and then providing opportunities and experiences for other people. So, I think that's what makes me successful to me. And it's not about P&L. There's no number that I've found that would be able to replace that freedom and that's really what my life boils down to.

**Irin:** You know, I never thought of that that way. Anybody who knows me knows that I know nothing about pop culture. It's really my co-author Shana who came with The Notorious R.B.G. and is much more tuned-in than I am. But it is a funny coincidence.

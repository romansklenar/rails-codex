# A hosty retreat

No full transcript available. The episode (0058, October 29, 2019) discusses why REWORK switched podcast hosting providers. After learning Art19 planned listener-targeted advertising, Basecamp's David Heinemeier Hansson decided to leave "by the end of the day." Features guests Lex Friedman (Art19) and Justin Jackson (Transistor), with hosts Wailin Wong and Shaun Hildner. Key topics include privacy concerns around targeted ads using anonymized IP-linked data, and Justin Jackson's philosophy of building "calm, mindful technology" that doesn't track users.

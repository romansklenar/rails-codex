# The Myth of the Overnight Sensation

**Kimberly (00:00):** Welcome to REWORK a podcast by 37signals about the better way to work and run your business. I'm your host Kimberly Rhodes, and I'm joined by the co-founders of 37signals, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. It is all kinds of celebration time around here because Basecamp just celebrated 20 years and 37signals is about to celebrate 25 years. This is perfect timing for us to talk about the chapter of the book called The Myth of the Overnight Sensation.

**Jason (00:39):** We just crossed about a million copies sold worldwide. That's digital print everything. I don't think we ever thought we'd get anywhere close to this. We didn't write it for that reason. We still get emails constantly, especially from India right now. It's great that it still has an impact.

**David (02:01):** The majority of the ideas, the majority of essays, they were extracted from either blog posts that Jason and I had written or points that we had made in presentations over a course of maybe at least seven years. So when we say it's not an overnight success, it's two layers of not an overnight success. First of all, to even release Basecamp, we'd been working in the industry for 10 years then to release REWORK, we'd been working with Basecamp for six or seven years. It took 14 years for REWORK to sell a million copies. That is very much the opposite of the overnight success.

**Jason (04:12):** I think we've always kind of thought of it as a product also just like our other products. I think if you think about books as a product, you're going to end up making something better versus just this thing you're going to put out there and then forget about.

**David (05:29):** The original manuscript for REWORK was 50,000 words. The manuscript we shipped was 25,000 words. The publisher flipped out when we turned in the final manuscript. We extracted half a million dollars as an advance. And then we turned in this half book and they freak out. We did not budge on a single word. We did not put in one line of filler anywhere. What we did was we increased the font size, we bumped up the line spacing, we shrunk the margins, and then we added a picture for every single one of the 87 essays.

**(08:25):** ASAP is Poison is four paragraphs. And the entire book was written with that maniacal focus on no jargon, no filler, no bullshit. 87 made it into the book out of hundreds, maybe even thousands of blog posts. And that was after being paired down.

**Jason (11:08):** Credit is due to a fellow named Rick Horgan. Rick was our editor. He really believed in us. He was surprised. He's like, but this is better and this is really, really good.

**David (12:06):** The Japanese version of REWORK is tiny. It is literally a quarter. What a beautiful illustration of cultural differences. But in the US it kind of created a Trojan Horse. People would pick this book up and they would expect it to be a normal business book and they found exactly the opposite.

**(14:29):** Our most ardent fans, we're telling them maybe a few new things, but we're also telling them a lot of things they already knew and were afraid to express. We're giving them permission.

**Jason (17:10):** If you just want to write, I think writing a book is held up too much. You can probably reach a lot more people if you write online. Forget the book part and just write one thing at a time, one day at a time, one essay at a time. And then maybe in a year or two or three, you have a book's worth of writing.

**David (20:06):** REWORK worked because it was a compilation of the greatest hits. We already knew these ideas were bangers. The overnight accumulation, the overnight inspiration of just grandeur is such a misnomer for almost anything that's ever been created. Very rarely do you get lightning in a bottle. I have a really poor sense of gauging whether something is interesting or not. The cloud exit post, I just wrote it in 10 minutes. Millions and millions of views.

**Jason (24:39):** We've been discussing potentially starting another book this year. It'd probably be very much about how we run the business today, like this sort of minimalist management style or running a company through intuition and by your gut versus by data. I think the truth is nobody really knows anything. You just kind of make it up as you go.

**Kimberly (26:26):** REWORK is a production of 37signals. You can find show notes and transcripts on our website at 37signals.com/podcast. Full video episodes are on YouTube and Twitter.

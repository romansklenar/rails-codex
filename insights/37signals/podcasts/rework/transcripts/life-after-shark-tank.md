# Life after Shark Tank

**Melissa:** "A lot of people had told me, you should apply for a show called Shark Tank. I had never even heard of it..."

**Wailin:** "It sounds like an entrepreneur's fairy tale, pitching your business to a panel of famous investors on national television."

**Shaun:** "Shark Tank is that show on ABC which is now going into its 10th season, where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of five famous investors..."

**Melissa:** "I am Melissa Butler. I am the founder and CEO of The Lip Bar. I found that most cosmetics were filled with unnecessary chemicals..."

**Joe:** "Yeah, my name is Joe Moore, I'm the CEO of First Defense Nasal Screens. My biggest thing was, I had an allergy attack while I was driving..."

**Chris:** "Hello, my name is Chris Ruder and I am CEO of Spikeball. A lot of people ask me how did I invent Spikeball, and I didn't."

**Melissa:** "Seven million people watch the show. I knew that that was seven million potential new customers..."

**Chris:** "We had a guest shark, we had Nick Woodman on, he's the founder, CEO of GoPro, and I was just thinking, all right. If I could get Nick Woodman and Mark Cuban, that is just absolute dream team."

**Joe:** "I watched some of the episodes and I knew that they want to know your valuations and how many have sold..."

**Melissa:** "So many emotions were going through my head at that time because I was thinking about like, who I am as a person, as a woman, as a woman of color."

**Melissa:** "So, when we went onto the show, we presented the idea of our Lip Bar truck and the Lip Bar truck was basically our way..."

**Melissa:** "Part of me was just like, you know, this is insulting me. But then I had to remember in that moment, and this is what allowed me to stay cool. This is a TV show."

**Joe:** "They were coming from every direction. I'm trying to do calculations in my head. It's very easy to get lost in all of that..."

**Joe:** "In this space, in a medical products space, about 3.8% royalty is the average. 10% royalty was huge."

**Chris:** "FUBU was a major brand and he just turned it into this amazing thing, so I was really hoping to learn, okay, how do you do that?"

**Chris:** "What he wanted to do was, I think he said, add some friends at Marvel comics, or something like that. And said, like, yeah, let's make a Spider-Man branded Spikeball set."

**Chris:** "I genuinely was hoping the deal would close and we'd—and I'd basically have his brainpower that I could tap into. But I did feel good in that I wasn't forced."

**Joe:** "One of the sharks recommended I didn't do the deal, actually, to me. And I was told. Do not stop running the business."

**Melissa:** "The idea that they laughed at, they told us that the Lip Bar truck was a horrible idea. I was hell-bent on building it."

**Melissa:** "We basically started channeling and funneling all of our money into fundraising for the Lip Bar truck and really just like, repurposing our profits..."

**Melissa:** "I emailed the buyer and I just pitched her. We've seen the rise of multi-cultural beauty, so I'm always using that within our pitch."

**Melissa:** "People come to me and say, like, wait, I think you were on Shark Tank. I'm like, yeah, that was a little blip on our radar."

**Chris:** "As I was leaving the stage, or talking to the producers afterwards, they're like, all right. Thanks for coming out, if your episode's going to air, we'll call you two weeks before it airs."

**Chris:** "We spent so much money. We had so much cash tied up into our product. Our warehouse was bursting at the seams waiting for this event that may never come."

**Melissa:** "Apparently we got really ratings because they've re-aired the episode like 16 times now. And every time they air it we notice a boost."

**Joe:** "Right now, it's been almost three years of negotiations. I'm negotiating with a very large company, I'm under a confidentiality contract, I can't say who they are."

**Melissa:** "We're actually still bootstrapping, which I'm actually really proud of. So, six years in, we've now launched into this major retailer..."

**Chris:** "When you go through the doors and you look at the sharks, that's literally the first time you see them. I assumed that when you go out there, maybe you see them backstage..."

**Wailin:** "The Lip Bar is at theLipBar.com, they have amazing product descriptions that you should definitely read."

**Shaun:** "Special thanks to Taylor Wizner and Sara Spiegel for their help with this episode."

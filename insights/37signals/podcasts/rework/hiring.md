# Hiring & Team

## When to Hire

- Hire when it genuinely hurts — not in anticipation of pain, not defensively, not because a great candidate exists
- "Hurt" means quality is slipping, fundamental work can't get done, or the team is structurally unable to reach important goals — not just feeling busy
- Use a moving average: a week or a month of frustration isn't enough; the pain must be persistent and clearly not solvable by cutting scope or saying no
- Hiring someone without enough real work for them is a disservice — underemployed skilled people generate work that doesn't need to exist (e.g., over-engineered legal policies, needless trademark registrations)
- Roles like in-house legal counsel that have 5–10 hours/week of actual work but get hired full-time consistently produce negative value by filling 40 hours with unnecessary activity
- It's acceptable — even healthy at 25+ years in — to carry a little "body fat": the team doesn't need to run at bone-lean 5% margin where losing one person triggers a crisis
- Distinguish between the pain threshold: a "5 out of 10" sustained over time now qualifies; it used to require an "8 or 9 out of 10" before acting — the threshold can be recalibrated as the company matures
- Hiring two people at once is often better than one: they start with a built-in peer, and you get a comparison point for evaluating progress and cultural fit
- Exception: accelerate the process (skip the open search) when someone highly trusted becomes available right when you were about to look anyway — treat it as a shortcut, not an impulse hire
- Redundancy is a valid reason to hire a second person in a role — if one person is the sole owner of a critical function (QA, finance, ops), the company cannot absorb their sabbatical or extended absence without risk
- "Hire when it hurts" applies to attrition too: when someone leaves, don't automatically refill the identical role — let it hurt a little, then decide if the scope should shift before re-hiring
- Preemptive or defensive hiring (hiring to block a competitor from getting talent) is an insult to the person hired and generates bullshit jobs — people who feel they contribute nothing are measurably more miserable than people who are out of a job
- Silicon Valley's binge-hire-then-mass-layoff cycles are a symptom of promise-driven roadmaps and too much capital, not a model to emulate
- The arithmetic test: if you have $85K of profit this year and the hire costs $80K, that may be worth it — you're roughly breakeven and there is still healthy pressure to perform; going into debt to hire is not a valid variant of this test
- Do not hire in anticipation of future pain ("we'll need this person in six months") — the business must already be ahead of you before the hurt justifies a hire; if the business is not ahead and it still hurts, the unit economics are broken and need to be fixed first, not papered over with headcount
- Raising money to hire ahead of revenue masks broken unit economics — if you're spending $2 to make $1, no volume of hiring or growth fixes it; fix the fundamentals before scaling the team
- The wrong kind of pressure (hire-into-debt, investor-deadline pressure) does not produce good products — it produces "freaking your way out" of a hard spot, which rarely works

## Who to Hire

- "Manager of One" is the single most important hiring criterion: candidates must be able to see work that needs doing, decide how to approach it, and execute without daily direction
- Look for entrepreneurial history — people who've run their own businesses, freelanced, or built things side-by-side to their day job handle autonomy well; people accustomed to receiving a daily task list do not
- Writing ability is a non-negotiable requirement for every role, regardless of technical specialty — communication at 37signals is primarily written, and poor writers cannot collaborate effectively
- Prefer people who can self-report progress, handle ambiguity, and make decisions within broad direction (six-week cycles) without needing constant check-ins
- For programmers, look for people who contribute to open source, build side projects, or otherwise produce real public work — candidates who don't wait to be given opportunities
- Avoid candidates who need external validation to make decisions; they create friction in a structure where every team member makes hundreds of small product calls per cycle
- Prior credentials (university, employer brand, years of experience) have near-zero predictive power for performance at 37signals — Google's own internal research showed the same conclusion
- Titles and tenure don't matter; the work does — always
- For non-technical roles, prefer candidates who are customers of the product: they bring direct experience of the actual pain, not a proxy understanding — the best marketing hire was someone who had used, left, and returned to Basecamp across different businesses
- Entrepreneurs make excellent non-traditional hires for roles like marketing: their natural frugality with budgets, bias toward doing-over-planning, and comfort with ambiguity are more valuable than years of title-specific experience
- When hiring for a role that doesn't exist yet, the shopping process itself is a discovery mechanism — you may find you wanted a different kind of person entirely once you see candidates side-by-side

## The Hiring Process

- Every application is read by a human — no keyword-filtering software, no AI screening; for 1,500+ applicants to a single role, this is still non-negotiable
- The cover letter is weighted equally or above the resume — it reveals personality, writing ability, specificity of interest, and genuine motivation; a resume is generic, a cover letter is directed
- Resumes are treated with skepticism: they're optimized for the best possible read of a career, claims of impact are rarely individually attributable, and they reveal nothing about fit for this specific company
- Roughly half of all applications can be discarded immediately for not following basic instructions in the job posting — use this as a first signal for attention to detail
- For programmers: 75 candidates out of 2,200+ might receive the take-home test; for designers: 5–6 finalists are invited to do a paid project
- The take-home test for programmers takes 4–6 hours and is a sample of real production-level work — evaluate code as prose: Is it clear? Succinct? Would a non-programmer understand the intent?
- For designers: finalists are hired for a week to work on a real design problem with a broad prompt (no research provided), then deliver both the work and a written explanation of their reasoning
- After delivering work, conversation about it is critical: ask what they'd change, what they're unhappy with, how they'd push it further — this reveals self-awareness, taste, and how they handle critique
- Past-looking interview questions outperform forward-looking ones: "Tell me about a project that didn't work out" reveals attitude, ownership, and critical thinking better than "Where do you see yourself in five years?"
- Compare candidates against each other rather than against an abstract ideal — human comparison is the tool you're best equipped for; trust the gut that emerges from seeing many candidates side-by-side
- For marketing and other hard-to-evaluate roles, give finalists the same paid project (same brief, same budget) and compare their instincts: does the candidate ask to spend the whole budget or question whether they need it?
- Paid work-sample projects reveal planning style: candidates who propose independently executable ideas score higher than those whose plans depend heavily on third-party coordination or external partnerships
- Job ads themselves are a filter — write them in the company's actual voice, describe what the person would have done last week, and name specific work; generic bullet-point ads attract generic candidates
- Remote-first hiring gives access to the entire world's talent pool; constraining to a 40-minute commute radius makes it nearly impossible to find someone who matches quirky principles

- Cover letters are read before resumes, not alongside them — at 37signals, Jason does not look at a resume until the cover letter earns it; the resume is never the first impression
- A cover letter should be specific to this company and this role, not a generic self-summary — if the letter could have been sent to any employer, it will read like one of the hundred that are immediately filtered out; the specificity is the signal
- **AI-written cover letters are detectable at scale**: a single AI letter may be indistinguishable from a human letter, but patterns emerge across a large applicant pool — phrasing structures, sentence-opening habits, and organizational templates repeat; pattern recognition across a sample size of hundreds is a different capability than evaluating one document in isolation
- Using AI as an editor (proofing, rephrasing a clunky paragraph) is acceptable and analogous to having a friend proofread — but having AI write the letter and tweaking 5% of it means the letter is not yours, and you're not the person being evaluated
- **Deadline behavior is a candidate signal**: applicants who request exceptions after the deadline because they waited until the last moment are advertising a procrastination pattern — the same pattern that will show up on the job; the deadline was posted alongside the opening, giving weeks of runway
- Being first to submit is not an advantage: applications are reviewed as a batch after the close date, not in arrival order; rushing an application to get in early typically means less time was invested in it
- Posting a closing date (not just "open until filled") is a candidate-respecting practice: applicants can pace their effort and submit thoughtfully rather than racing to beat an unknown clock
- **Designer cover letters as crafted artifacts**: some design candidates build a mini-site or designed PDF for their cover letter — this is not requested but signals design sensibility, initiative, and understanding of what the role actually is; extra effort in format is recognized and respected even if not required
- **If you're hiring humans, humans should do the hiring**: algorithmic or AI pre-screening is understandable at massive hiring scale, but at small company scale it offloads a skill (evaluating people) that the founders and team need to develop themselves; hiring judgment compounds over years; outsourcing it to a system early stunts that growth
- Founders should do all hiring personally as long as possible — Jason and David handled hiring themselves for years before delegating; the first-hand experience of reading hundreds of cover letters and resumes calibrates taste in ways no briefing can replicate

## Hiring for Senior & Executive Roles

- C-level hiring is the only category where 37signals uses a recruiter — the goal is to reach people who are not actively looking but would consider being recruited
- The paid-work-sample test does not translate well to executive roles: you cannot evaluate an executive the way you evaluate a programmer or designer, which is why executive hiring so often goes wrong
- For COO/executive candidates, writing replaces the deck: ask candidates to respond in writing to a set of scenarios — no PowerPoint, no Keynote, because that is not how 37signals works
- Chemistry and gravitas are the decisive factors at this level, not credentials — a candidate can be overqualified on paper and still feel wrong in the room after three or four conversations
- In-person meetings are essential for senior hires even at a distributed company: Zoom conversations reveal competence, in-person reveals fit
- Resist the impulse to close on the first strong candidate — the person who stands out early often falls short once more candidates are seen; beware of hiring just to end the interview process
- When adding a third person to a long-running two-person executive team, evaluate for complementary temperament (e.g., calming to the team's existing dynamic), not just complementary skills
- Allow months for the process — four to five months is appropriate for a COO-level search; rushing produces regret

## Writing as a Hiring Signal

- Cover letters are the primary filter because writing quality directly predicts day-to-day performance — the majority of 37signals communication is written, so a weak cover letter predicts a weak colleague
- Writing forces clarity of thought; asking someone to write a proposal reveals whether their idea holds up under their own scrutiny
- For design candidates, the final deliverable is a written explanation of the work — great design with no articulation of reasoning is disqualifying
- For programming candidates, the take-home test is partly evaluated as prose: naming choices, code structure, commit messages, and documentation are read as writing
- Code should be written such that a non-specialist designer can roughly follow the intent — heavy jargon is a negative signal, not a positive one
- Writing quality is a company-wide expectation — customer support, marketing, operations — no role is exempt, because async collaboration is the default mode of work
- Hiring great writers creates compounding benefits: written decisions, pitches, and project updates accumulate as searchable institutional memory; they scale linearly whereas meetings scale exponentially
- For customer support candidates, tone in the writing sample matters more than correctness — look for genuine voice even in a formal application context; stiffness that doesn't ease over time is a predictor of scripted responses
- For executive candidates, ask them to respond to scenarios in writing rather than deck presentations; the quality and specificity of written communication is the signal that substitutes for a work sample

- **The cover letter is the first answer in the interview**: it is not a formality before the real process begins — it is the process beginning; evaluating it rigorously from the first line sets the standard for what clear communication at the company looks like
- A cover letter that could have been sent to any employer reveals that the applicant did not read the job posting carefully; the ability to respond specifically to what was actually written is the same skill required to understand a shaped pitch, a customer complaint, or a design critique
- **Most applicants phone it in**: in a competitive market the gap between median effort and standout effort is small in absolute hours but enormous in impression; a cover letter that demonstrates genuine interest and clear thinking places the applicant in the top 5–10% without requiring exceptional experience

## Interview Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Whiteboard coding assesses the wrong things — evaluators focus on syntax errors and missed library calls rather than problem decomposition and clarity; it stresses candidates in ways unrelated to job performance
- Brain teasers ("why are manhole covers round?") test coaching, not thinking — coached candidates pass, uncoached ones fail, regardless of engineering ability
- Trivia questions test memorization; real engineering work involves looking things up and asking teammates, so memory recall is not a valid job proxy
- Take-home tests given to hundreds of unvetted candidates are hazing, not hiring — 37signals only assigns take-home work to pre-qualified finalists
- Forward-looking soft questions ("describe your greatest weakness") are answered formulaically by prepared candidates and stumbled on by unprepped-but-capable ones; ask about real past events instead
- Portfolio review discriminates against engineers at companies with NDAs or moonlighting clauses — don't require it as the sole proof of ability
- Trying to expose candidate weaknesses instead of discover strengths produces bad hiring decisions and damages the company's reputation as an employer
- Evaluating marketing candidates by their resume metrics ("increased ROI 43%") is unreliable — results are rarely individually attributable and correlate poorly with ability to execute at a new company
- Measuring marketing via a fixed budget exercise reveals mindset: professional marketers spend the budget because that is what is expected; entrepreneurs question whether the budget is even necessary

## Finding a Good Employer (Candidate Perspective)

- Job postings reveal company culture before you apply: look at what the company brags about — raising money, "passion," after-hours activities, and "hard work" are all red flags for overwork culture
- "Hard work" in a job posting is a euphemism for long hours; no calm company uses it because 40 hours is already hard work
- Company blogs, founder interviews, and how executives talk about pride tell you more about culture than the job description itself
- Remote-first companies are visible by what they don't say: they don't list office perks, ping-pong tables, or catered lunches as draws
- Fraudulent job postings targeting remote workers are common: if you are never asked to speak with a real person (phone or video), treat it as a scam; legitimate employers want to know you are a real person
- Scam signals: a free email domain (e.g., gmail) used by the "company," requests for personal bank information before starting, payment upfront for "materials," and compensation that sounds impossibly fast
- Report job fraud to the FTC and FBI via their public portals; companies whose names are used cannot legally stop impersonation but can confirm through official channels whether a role is real
- Evaluate a company by its behaviors, not its perks — ping-pong tables and unlimited vacation signal nothing meaningful; look instead for whether the company measures outcomes or time-in-seat, whether it enables async communication, and whether it explicitly caps weekly hours
- Fall in love with a company, not a job — find an employer whose values you want to work inside, then wait for the right role to open rather than accepting any role that matches your skills at a company you are ambivalent about
- Salary transparency in a job posting is a strong positive signal; withholding it signals the employer treats compensation as leverage over candidates
- Companies that are genuinely remote-first became so before it was forced on them — prior remote history (partial or full) before a crisis is meaningful evidence of real infrastructure and norms, not just a policy

## Job Scams & Fraud

- Remote-hiring reputation makes companies like Basecamp targets for impersonation: scammers use old job postings to construct plausible-looking offers, spoof email addresses, and collect personal data or banking information
- A convincing fraudulent offer will include: realistic company branding, a test-work assignment, a plausible reason to provide bank details for "payment," and social proof from other fake employees
- The harm is compounded: victims do real work, hand over personal data, and are not paid — targeting job-seekers is "extra terrible" because of their financial vulnerability
- Defence as a company: monitor your brand on job boards and social media; report impersonation to Gmail/Facebook's fraud teams and the FTC; alert candidates through official job channels when scams appear
- Defence as a candidate: if a process is entirely via email with no live conversation, stop; if the onboarding asks for bank details before a signed contract, stop; if it sounds too good to be true, it is
- Job boards and Craigslist carry disclaimers, but social media ads (Facebook) do not — scams increasingly run through paid social where there is no built-in warning

→ Episodes: [Job scam](https://37signals.com/podcast/job-scam/)

## Performance Management & Reviews

- New employees receive reviews at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months — the one-year mark is a rehiring decision: "Would we hire this person again? Hell yeah?"
- Ongoing employees transition to annual reviews after the first year; the format is manager evaluation plus self-reflection, using a matrix of "did not meet / met / exceeded expectations" per level
- 360-degree peer reviews were abandoned — they generated too much effort for too little return; managers and the employees themselves are closest to the work
- No full-time managers means no dedicated performance-review specialists — HR (a team of two) and senior individual contributors handle review administration as a part-time responsibility
- Five levels: junior (L1), programmer (L2), senior (L3), lead (L4), principal (L5) — same structure on both programming and design tracks
- Performance management relies on automated check-ins (Basecamp asks "What did you work on today?" and "What will you work on this week?") rather than standups or status meetings
- "Hell yeah or no" applies to employment as much as to projects: continued employment should clear a high bar, not just "they're fine"
- The worst performance reviews share a structural failure: success criteria are undefined or communicated only at review time, never during the work itself — employees who ask for feedback and receive only generalizations ("it wasn't what we wanted") are experiencing a management failure, not a performance failure
- Employees bear some responsibility too: self-assessments matter; asking specific questions ("what's one thing I could do 10% better?") yields specific feedback, while vague asks ("how am I doing?") yield vague answers
- Design feedback at 37signals is informal and opt-in: a designer pings the CEO or product strategist when they want a second opinion, not on a fixed schedule; this eliminates the anxiety of mandatory formal reviews and preserves the designer's ownership of the decision

## Team Structure & Management Philosophy

- There are no full-time managers at 37signals — everyone who carries managerial responsibilities also does direct individual-contributor work; management is a part-time role for all
- The programming team uses a mentorship model: L4/L5 programmers are each assigned one mentee (L2 or L3), with responsibility for code review, cycle kick-offs, and annual performance reviews
- **Formalized, named mentorship for new programmers**: rather than relying on whoever has time, each new programmer is assigned a specific named mentor; that mentor is explicitly accountable for reviewing the new person's work on a weekly mandatory basis, regardless of cycle pressure; this prevents work from drifting too far down a wrong path before anyone notices
- Mentorship is about teaching values and decision-making, not task assignment — the goal is to make the mentee capable of making decisions independently
- Code review in one-on-ones (live on Zoom, walking through pull requests together) outperforms async comments alone — it allows explanation of "why," live iteration, and avoids mentees just copying suggestions without understanding
- Lead programmers mentor as a part-time obligation — each lead has at most one or two reports, keeping managerial overhead to roughly 5 hours/week
- **Hierarchical feedback vs. peer feedback**: feedback from a designated mentor or manager carries a different weight than suggestions from a peer — it is "redirecting feedback," meaning the new direction is not optional; this clarity is valuable even if it feels like a power structure, because it eliminates the ambiguity of "do I have to do this?" that peer-only review leaves unresolved
- The career ladder avoids the Peter Principle: individual contributors peak at senior (L3) if they want to stay heads-down; L4/L5 roles require broader organizational influence but are not pure management roles
- All-hands meetings happen once per six-week cycle during cooldown; they are non-mandatory, about one hour, and structured around product updates, team spotlights, and peer appreciation — not status reporting
- The best way to wreck a good team is to introduce a manager who has more hours than there is work to do; that person will invent work for others
- The drop of product management needed by each two-person feature team is tiny — one product manager supporting six simultaneous feature teams is sufficient, not one per team

## Two-Person Teams as the Hiring Unit

- The atomic product team at 37signals is one programmer plus one designer — this is not a staffing shortcut but a deliberate structural choice backed by 20+ years of iteration
- Two-person teams work because they eliminate translation layers: there is no PM relaying the designer's intent to the programmer or vice versa; both work in the same codebase simultaneously
- Designers at 37signals write HTML, JavaScript, and some Ruby — the shared technical material is what makes two-person teams possible; a designer who can only work in Figma creates a translation problem
- Five teams at once on a single product is too many — three is the sweet spot for Basecamp; beyond that, coordination overhead exceeds the output gain
- When adding capacity, add parallel two-person teams, not more people to an existing team — two teams of two outperform one team of four
- Two-person teams handle vacation and sickness through scope flexibility, not bench warmers: if a designer is out for a week, the programmer works ahead on things that don't require them; scope absorbs the gap
- The "two-person team" label applies to feature work, not to entire products: multiple teams touch the same product; if one team is out, another can respond
- For non-product functions (finance, QA, people ops), the principle is the same — roles that start as one-person positions should eventually grow to two for redundancy and the mental health of the sole owner
- Sole-owner roles have an expiration date: someone who is the only person doing a type of work for more than a couple of years goes "a little stir crazy" — they need a peer who understands the work, not just a manager who oversees it

## Trust, Autonomy & New Employee Ramp

- New hires start at roughly 50% on the "trust battery" — enough to get going, not enough to deploy to production alone on day one
- Trust is individual: a manager's trust battery with one employee may be at 75% while with another it is at 35%, based on accumulated experience
- New programmers have a mentor who reviews all their code before it ships — this is not distrust, it is protection: deploying something that takes the app down on your first week is a punishment, not an opportunity
- Trust scales up naturally — as a new hire demonstrates judgment over multiple cycles, oversight recedes; the mentorship check-in frequency drops as the mentee's confidence and track record build
- "Default to trust" is the winning bet over 20 years: two episodes that could be called "taking advantage" occurred in two decades; the cost of surveillance and verification would have far exceeded those losses
- Unlimited vacation policies often fail not because people abuse them but because people take less vacation when there is no floor; a fixed minimum (37signals: three weeks mandatory) outperforms unlimited in practice
- When policies are vague, "abuse" is often a failure of clarity: if someone takes eight weeks and you thought seven was the limit, the policy is wrong, not the person
- New hires find the autonomy disorienting at first — being given a single-page brief with squiggly sketches and told to ship something great in six weeks is unusual; most workplaces have task lists, standups, and daily direction
- The goal is for people to live up to high expectations, not down to low ones — even junior hires are delegated full projects, not task lists; the best junior hires reveal themselves immediately by rising to that challenge

## Compensation & Equity

- 37signals does not offer equity or stock options — no signing bonuses, no lottery tickets
- Compensation philosophy: high base pay (benchmarked at top 10% of San Francisco rates) removes the speculative risk factor; workers know what they are getting
- Profit sharing distributes 10% of profits annually, weighted by tenure (not by salary or role) — everyone who has been here N years receives the same share of the pool regardless of their job level
- Tenure-based profit sharing is deliberate: it rewards staying, not just performing; someone who has survived the company's evaluation process for seven years is highly valuable regardless of title
- The profit sharing cap is set at 10 years — long-tenured employees do not accumulate unlimited shares; the cap prevents the pool from concentrating among founders and very early hires
- In a liquidity event (sale of the company), the same tenure-based unit model applies — no special founder or early-employee windfall at the expense of long-serving team members
- Two employees left over 20 years specifically because they wanted equity upside instead of high base pay; that is the correct tradeoff for them — 37signals cannot offer unicorn prospects and does not try to
- This model is congruent with company identity: a slow-growth, profitable, privately-held company is not a rocket ship; pretending to offer rocket-ship compensation would be dishonest

## Onboarding

- Support team onboarding is structured into thematic modules spread over two weeks in-person: day 1 covers company history and philosophy, subsequent days cover team structure, product lines, and daily workflows
- Three trainers are assigned per two new hires during in-person onboarding weeks — absorbs queue burden while preventing trainers from being sole blockers
- New support hires answer their first real customer email by day two of training — early real work grounds all the conceptual material in actual context
- The first weeks prioritize psychological safety: new hires are explicitly told it's safe to ask questions, to hand off a difficult case to a teammate, and to set boundaries around response volume
- A "Basecamp buddy" — someone outside the new hire's immediate team — is assigned from day one to answer questions about how other parts of the company work
- Written materials (guides, glossaries, checklists) are stored permanently in Basecamp and remain available after training ends — the goal is gradual ramp with lasting reference material
- Tribal knowledge is explicitly documented in team glossaries: team-specific terms, abbreviations, and norms are codified so new hires don't feel excluded by insider language
- For product teams, new hires should expect that the first cycle will be disorienting — the single-page brief and high autonomy are by design, and the first cycle rarely produces a slam dunk; that is normal and expected

# Hiring & Team

## When to Hire

- Hire when it genuinely hurts — not in anticipation of pain, not defensively, not because a great candidate exists
- "Hurt" means quality is slipping, fundamental work can't get done, or the team is structurally unable to reach important goals — not just feeling busy
- Use a moving average: a week or a month of frustration isn't enough; the pain must be persistent and clearly not solvable by cutting scope or saying no
- Hiring someone without enough real work for them is a disservice — underemployed skilled people generate work that doesn't need to exist (e.g., over-engineered legal policies, needless trademark registrations)
- Roles like in-house legal counsel that have 5–10 hours/week of actual work but get hired full-time consistently produce negative value by filling 40 hours with unnecessary activity
- It's acceptable — even healthy at 25+ years in — to carry a little "body fat": the team doesn't need to run at bone-lean 5% margin where losing one person triggers a crisis
- Distinguish between the pain threshold: a "5 out of 10" sustained over time now qualifies; it used to require an "8 or 9 out of 10" before acting — the threshold can be recalibrated as the company matures
- Hiring two people at once is often better than one: they start with a built-in peer, and you get a comparison point for evaluating progress and cultural fit
- Exception: accelerate the process (skip the open search) when someone highly trusted becomes available right when you were about to look anyway — treat it as a shortcut, not an impulse hire

## Who to Hire

- "Manager of One" is the single most important hiring criterion: candidates must be able to see work that needs doing, decide how to approach it, and execute without daily direction
- Look for entrepreneurial history — people who've run their own businesses, freelanced, or built things side-by-side to their day job handle autonomy well; people accustomed to receiving a daily task list do not
- Writing ability is a non-negotiable requirement for every role, regardless of technical specialty — communication at 37signals is primarily written, and poor writers cannot collaborate effectively
- Prefer people who can self-report progress, handle ambiguity, and make decisions within broad direction (six-week cycles) without needing constant check-ins
- For programmers, look for people who contribute to open source, build side projects, or otherwise produce real public work — candidates who don't wait to be given opportunities
- Avoid candidates who need external validation to make decisions; they create friction in a structure where every team member makes hundreds of small product calls per cycle
- Prior credentials (university, employer brand, years of experience) have near-zero predictive power for performance at 37signals — Google's own internal research showed the same conclusion
- Titles and tenure don't matter; the work does — always

## The Hiring Process

- Every application is read by a human — no keyword-filtering software, no AI screening; for 1,500+ applicants to a single role, this is still non-negotiable
- The cover letter is weighted equally or above the resume — it reveals personality, writing ability, specificity of interest, and genuine motivation; a resume is generic, a cover letter is directed
- Resumes are treated with skepticism: they're optimized for the best possible read of a career, claims of impact are rarely individually attributable, and they reveal nothing about fit for this specific company
- Roughly half of all applications can be discarded immediately for not following basic instructions in the job posting — use this as a first signal for attention to detail
- For programmers: 75 candidates out of 2,200+ might receive the take-home test; for designers: 5–6 finalists are invited to do a paid project
- The take-home test for programmers takes 4–6 hours and is a sample of real production-level work — evaluate code as prose: Is it clear? Succinct? Would a non-programmer understand the intent?
- For designers: finalists are hired for a week to work on a real design problem with a broad prompt (no research provided), then deliver both the work and a written explanation of their reasoning
- After delivering work, conversation about it is critical: ask what they'd change, what they're unhappy with, how they'd push it further — this reveals self-awareness, taste, and how they handle critique
- Past-looking interview questions outperform forward-looking ones: "Tell me about a project that didn't work out" reveals attitude, ownership, and critical thinking better than "Where do you see yourself in five years?"
- Compare candidates against each other rather than against an abstract ideal — human comparison is the tool you're best equipped for; trust the gut that emerges from seeing many candidates side-by-side

## Writing as a Hiring Signal

- Cover letters are the primary filter because writing quality directly predicts day-to-day performance — the majority of 37signals communication is written, so a weak cover letter predicts a weak colleague
- Writing forces clarity of thought; asking someone to write a proposal reveals whether their idea holds up under their own scrutiny
- For design candidates, the final deliverable is a written explanation of the work — great design with no articulation of reasoning is disqualifying
- For programming candidates, the take-home test is partly evaluated as prose: naming choices, code structure, commit messages, and documentation are read as writing
- Code should be written such that a non-specialist designer can roughly follow the intent — heavy jargon is a negative signal, not a positive one
- Writing quality is a company-wide expectation — customer support, marketing, operations — no role is exempt, because async collaboration is the default mode of work
- Hiring great writers creates compounding benefits: written decisions, pitches, and project updates accumulate as searchable institutional memory; they scale linearly whereas meetings scale exponentially

## Interview Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Whiteboard coding assesses the wrong things — evaluators focus on syntax errors and missed library calls rather than problem decomposition and clarity; it stresses candidates in ways unrelated to job performance
- Brain teasers ("why are manhole covers round?") test coaching, not thinking — coached candidates pass, uncoached ones fail, regardless of engineering ability
- Trivia questions test memorization; real engineering work involves looking things up and asking teammates, so memory recall is not a valid job proxy
- Take-home tests given to hundreds of unvetted candidates are hazing, not hiring — 37signals only assigns take-home work to pre-qualified finalists
- Forward-looking soft questions ("describe your greatest weakness") are answered formulaically by prepared candidates and stumbled on by unprepped-but-capable ones; ask about real past events instead
- Portfolio review discriminates against engineers at companies with NDAs or moonlighting clauses — don't require it as the sole proof of ability
- Trying to expose candidate weaknesses instead of discover strengths produces bad hiring decisions and damages the company's reputation as an employer

## Performance Management & Reviews

- New employees receive reviews at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months — the one-year mark is a rehiring decision: "Would we hire this person again? Hell yeah?"
- Ongoing employees transition to annual reviews after the first year; the format is manager evaluation plus self-reflection, using a matrix of "did not meet / met / exceeded expectations" per level
- 360-degree peer reviews were abandoned — they generated too much effort for too little return; managers and the employees themselves are closest to the work
- No full-time managers means no dedicated performance-review specialists — HR (a team of two) and senior individual contributors handle review administration as a part-time responsibility
- Five levels: junior (L1), programmer (L2), senior (L3), lead (L4), principal (L5) — same structure on both programming and design tracks
- Performance management relies on automated check-ins (Basecamp asks "What did you work on today?" and "What will you work on this week?") rather than standups or status meetings
- "Hell yeah or no" applies to employment as much as to projects: continued employment should clear a high bar, not just "they're fine"

## Team Structure & Management Philosophy

- There are no full-time managers at 37signals — everyone who carries managerial responsibilities also does direct individual-contributor work; management is a part-time role for all
- The programming team uses a mentorship model: L4/L5 programmers are each assigned one mentee (L2 or L3), with responsibility for code review, cycle kick-offs, and annual performance reviews
- Mentorship is about teaching values and decision-making, not task assignment — the goal is to make the mentee capable of making decisions independently
- Code review in one-on-ones (live on Zoom, walking through pull requests together) outperforms async comments alone — it allows explanation of "why," live iteration, and avoids mentees just copying suggestions without understanding
- Lead programmers mentor as a part-time obligation — each lead has at most one or two reports, keeping managerial overhead to roughly 5 hours/week
- The career ladder avoids the Peter Principle: individual contributors peak at senior (L3) if they want to stay heads-down; L4/L5 roles require broader organizational influence but are not pure management roles
- All-hands meetings happen once per six-week cycle during cooldown; they are non-mandatory, about one hour, and structured around product updates, team spotlights, and peer appreciation — not status reporting

## Onboarding

- Support team onboarding is structured into thematic modules spread over two weeks in-person: day 1 covers company history and philosophy, subsequent days cover team structure, product lines, and daily workflows
- Three trainers are assigned per two new hires during in-person onboarding weeks — absorbs queue burden while preventing trainers from being sole blockers
- New support hires answer their first real customer email by day two of training — early real work grounds all the conceptual material in actual context
- The first weeks prioritize psychological safety: new hires are explicitly told it's safe to ask questions, to hand off a difficult case to a teammate, and to set boundaries around response volume
- A "Basecamp buddy" — someone outside the new hire's immediate team — is assigned from day one to answer questions about how other parts of the company work
- Written materials (guides, glossaries, checklists) are stored permanently in Basecamp and remain available after training ends — the goal is gradual ramp with lasting reference material
- Tribal knowledge is explicitly documented in team glossaries: team-specific terms, abbreviations, and norms are codified so new hires don't feel excluded by insider language

# Communication

## Internal Communication Principles

- You cannot not communicate — silence, avoidance, and non-answers are all communication; leaving a vacuum invites rumors and negative interpretation
- Never expect or require immediate responses; the expectation of instant reply is toxic and disrespects others' time
- If words can be interpreted in multiple ways, they will be understood in the way that does the most harm — favor short, clear, low-surface-area language for important matters
- Time is on your side: rushing conversations produces worse outcomes; let heated exchanges cool before forcing resolution
- Write to be read, not transcribed — Kickoffs and Heartbeats written with intention are gifts to the organization; AI-generated meeting transcripts are not
- Async long-form writing is the primary operating mode; Basecamp messages are expected to receive responses in hours or days, not seconds
- Institutional memory lives in written threads, not in chat scroll — 37signals has retrieved context from Basecamp threads seven years old
- Avoid gamifying internal communication: Applause-style like buttons create power-dynamic anxiety, reward cheap engagement, and corrupt internal compasses for what is actually good
- The "37signals Guide to Internal Communication" (30 principles) serves as the onboarding reference for all new hires on how the org communicates

## Async vs. Real-Time Chat

- Async is the default; real-time chat is a tool for social conversation and quick one-on-one exchanges, not project management or deep work
- Chat is appropriate for: social channels, one-on-one riffs, sharing quick links — not for tracking multi-person project decisions
- Chat-first work cultures fragment attention, cause things to fall through the cracks, and make it impossible to onboard new teammates who can't reconstruct context from scroll
- The medium carries expectations: Slack-style tools condition users to expect instant replies; Basecamp messages condition patience and thoughtfulness
- Chat history at 37signals auto-deletes after two years by design — anything worth keeping goes in a Basecamp message, to-do, or document with a permanent URL
- Five uninterrupted hours of focused work is the productivity standard; constant chat monitoring makes this impossible for most workers who have never experienced it
- Do not default to chat for complex decisions — verbal and chat descriptions create illusions of agreement; written proposals make misalignment visible

## Cycle Communication: Kickoffs and Heartbeats

- Every six weeks, each department head publishes a Kickoff: a plain-language description of projects the team intends to pursue, including appetite (budget) not estimates
- Kickoffs are shared company-wide so every team knows what every other team is working on — the antidote to "what are they even doing over there?"
- Heartbeats close each cycle: a retrospective of what the team actually did, including reactive work, shoutouts to individuals, and surprises
- The Kickoff/Heartbeat rhythm is tied to Shape Up's six-week cycle — a predictable cadence makes it easy to hook communication rituals to it
- Kickoffs contain no individual task assignments — teams decide their own approach; leaders set direction, not method
- For reactive teams (Ops, SIP, support), Heartbeats often contain more unplanned work than Kickoff work; schedule only 50% capacity for those teams
- These writeups let new employees read up on a year of company history at their own pace — far more useful than recordings of Zoom status calls
- The Kickoff serves as a self-restraint mechanism for founders: ideas go on a "card table" and are only pulled out at the next cycle planning discussion, not acted on impulsively

- Shape Up's six-week cadence runs for every team at 37signals (Support, Ops, Finance, People Ops, Marketing) — the shared clock frequency is as much a communication ritual as a scheduling one; everyone can follow any department's Kickoff/Heartbeat without needing constant updates
- For high-interrupt teams (Ops, SIP), plan only ~50% capacity in the Kickoff and reserve the other half for reactive work; do not hold reactive teams to the same project-density as product teams
- Shape Up acts as a founder-protection mechanism: ideas must sit until the next betting table instead of interrupting whoever's on a project; the cadence contains the impulse to tap someone on the shoulder with every new bright idea
- Six weeks is not a magic number — the principle is a time-box with a visible end; adapt the length (8, 11, 12 weeks) to your context while keeping the boundary-creates-decision-pressure logic intact

## Customer Communication

- Founders must talk directly to customers — Jason personally emailed all Basecamp 3/4 customers before the Basecamp 5 launch and replied to every response individually, no assistant, no AI
- Direct founder-to-customer contact produces the highest-fidelity product insight; aggregate pipelines (support tickets → AI summaries → quarterly reports) destroy the nutrients in customer feedback
- Ask one open-ended question at a time, not 30 multiple-choice items on a scale of 0–10; single open questions yield 1,600+ rich, usable responses vs. meaningless statistics
- Customer language is a goldmine: terms customers use to describe their own problems become the marketing copy and feature names (e.g., "things falling through the cracks")
- Quantitative surveys are gameable and ultra-processed; open-ended anecdotes train gut instincts and reveal customer motivation, not just behavior
- Scan your customer list and proactively reach out — noticing a notable name in an order and writing to them personally builds durable word-of-mouth
- Publishing a founder's direct email address (no assistant, no AI relay) is a differentiator — it signals accessibility and creates personal bonds that outlast product frustrations
- Direct customer communication also surfaces product misunderstandings: many "feature requests" are for things that already exist but aren't discoverable

- Launch first, then step into the firehose — do not do pre-launch customer research asking what people want; build something, ship it, then learn from real users at scale; there is no better research instrument than a live product with actual customers
- Post-launch customer conversations surface problems you never anticipated but can fix immediately — the act of responding to that volume in the first days after launch is itself the best product education available

## Public and External Communication

- Press releases are spam: formulaic, ineffective at driving traffic, and produce fake quotes that make founders feel like idiots — 37signals' Basecamp 4 press release generated broad coverage and zero measurable impact
- The alternative to press releases is being interesting: ship something novel, take a genuine contrarian position, or reveal a compelling angle that makes coverage inherently earned
- Authentic founder voice outperforms company-brand voice — no one at 37signals writes tweets or emails for Jason or David; delegating your voice is the one thing you must never do
- A major editorial placement (The Verge, TechCrunch) now drives less traffic than a throwaway tweet written in seconds — the media landscape has permanently shifted toward direct-to-consumer
- Cultivate relationships with individual writers who cover things out of genuine interest (e.g., Daring Fireball) rather than blasting press wires — targeted outreach beats spray-and-pray
- Founder-led marketing is a superpower unavailable to large companies: the person with the most skin in the game speaking directly to customers cannot be replicated by a marketing department
- Avoid off-season burnout on social platforms — extended breaks are necessary to avoid the attention economy pulling you into performing a character rather than being authentic

- Small companies have a structural communication advantage unavailable to large ones: no legal or PR filter means ideas go straight from mind to published word; filtering through committees produces "perfectly round pebbles that don't mean anything"
- Writing by committee is instantly detectable — read any corporate mission statement; the goal is to sound like a specific human being, not a legal minimum viable statement
- Find your native medium before forcing yourself into writing: Gary Vaynerchuk built his brand on video because that was his native form; a bad writer who's a great speaker should podcast or shoot video, not grind out blog posts
- Authentic publishing is a body-of-work endeavor, not a single-post endeavor — expect nothing to happen in the first 50 pieces; the hits emerge from volume and consistency, not from optimizing one post
- Publishing vanity metrics (likes, views, follower counts) visible from day one make starting almost psychologically impossible; 37signals built HEY World without article-level read counts specifically to protect writers developing their voice
- "Content marketing" as a frame is corrupting because it implies you're writing toward a result rather than writing what you actually believe — readers detect instrumentalism and discount it accordingly
- Avoid over-reviewing your own work: publishing something without nine people giving feedback is the right default; over-reviewing creates the same filtered blandness as corporate PR review
- Client service businesses can and should set communication norms from day one: if you respond at 11 PM, clients will keep sending at 11 PM; set expectations explicitly ("I'll reply tomorrow morning") and clients adapt to your rhythm, not the other way around
- Never proactively over-promise availability to clients — announcing "my cell is always on" invites an abusive relationship that erodes all other boundaries, not just time ones

- Buying a product is a vote — customers buy the company and its values, not only the feature set; communicate what you stand for explicitly because no one will do it for you, especially early on
- Longevity and stability are underrated competitive differentiators in SaaS: a company that has been around for 25 years and never killed a product speaks louder than any marketing claim about reliability
- Reputation is a moat available to small companies: each time a large competitor sunsets a beloved product, it is an opportunity to publicly restate your own commitment to permanence
- Teach and give away knowledge without expecting anything in return — "content marketing" framing corrupts the act; give because you have something useful, and customers who benefit from the free knowledge become advocates and buyers
- Retail politics: one-on-one founder interactions with customers (support, direct email replies) build brand affinity at a scale no campaign can replicate; Jason handled all Basecamp support personally for two-plus years at launch
- A customer who experiences a failure that gets fixed with exceptional care often becomes a stronger advocate than one who had no problem at all — the recovery story is the one that spreads
- Never hold a grudge against customers who left and come back; update your priors when someone who previously criticized your work returns — the capacity to change minds, in both directions, is healthy for a marketplace

## Crisis Communication and Apologies

- When something goes wrong, pick the "this is a huge deal" token — if you downplay it, customers will escalate to "this is the biggest deal ever"; if you own it fully, they often respond with "this isn't that big a deal"
- Write human apologies, not corporate ones: "I fucked up" beats "we regret any inconvenience that may have occurred"; weasel language signals inauthenticity immediately
- Name specifically what you did wrong; conditional or vague apologies ("sorry if anyone was offended") universally backfire
- Don't sacrifice an individual employee as a proxy for systemic failure — "rogue employee" narratives are usually dishonest; rogue actions are expressions of organizational culture
- A genuine apology must be followed by organizational change, not just words — the cat.jpg incident led to a full privacy policy rewrite, internal access controls, and an access logging system
- Status page communication during outages is a customer service task, not an engineering task — overly technical outage explanations increase frustration even for technical users
- Communicate outage status via infrastructure that stays up even when your product is down; baking your status page into the product means it goes dark precisely when customers need it most
- Do not demand forgiveness in an apology — offer it, let the other party decide, and accept that accepting an apology is distinct from forgiving

## Feedback and Acknowledgment Design

- Like buttons in work tools introduce power-dynamic anxiety: managers who applaud some daily check-ins but not others signal perceived favoritism even when none is intended
- Gamifying work communication (applause counts, likes, hearts) corrupts individual judgment about quality — DHH found himself unable to trust his own assessment of content after chasing applause metrics
- The replacement for likes in Basecamp: "Whispers" — short (12-character), no notifications, text-required micro-acknowledgments that stack horizontally and form a quiet visual crowd
- Requiring even minimal effort (typing something vs. clicking a button) meaningfully raises the quality and authenticity of peer acknowledgment
- The goal of acknowledgment tooling is to confirm receipt, not to generate engagement metrics — Basecamp has no ad model requiring eyeballs, so engagement maximization is actively harmful
- Long-form work (data reports, research writeups) deserves explicit acknowledgment mechanisms so authors know their work was read — silence after effort damages motivation

→ Episodes: dont-like-this, dont-like-this-update

## Customer Support Voice

- The goal of support writing is to sound like a specific individual, not like a company — at 37signals, every support rep sounds slightly different, and that's the point; genuine variety beats enforced brand uniformity
- Ban "sorry for the inconvenience" and "apologies for the inconvenience" — phrases so overused they carry no meaning and signal a scripted response the customer is not actually being heard
- Never write "actually" in a support reply: the word implies the customer missed something obvious and carries a subtle accusation of stupidity even when none is intended
- Mirror the customer's emotional state: if they're terse and task-focused, match that; if they're distressed, bring warmth; being ebullient when someone is furious is "super annoying"
- Err on the side of extra exclamation points over none — "thanks." with a period signals coldness and is reliably misread as hostile; a slightly chipper reply is a better trade-off than a curt one
- In negative or escalating interactions, the support rep's humanity is the intervention: show explicitly that a real person read the message carefully; many customers have never experienced that and escalate precisely because they assume they're talking to a bot or script
- When hiring for support, evaluate tone and voice over factual correctness in writing samples — the right answer delivered in stilted corporate language is a worse hire than the warm communicator who needs product training
- Formal language in writing samples is expected during applications; look for genuine tone underneath the formality, especially whether the applicant is "looking for the person on the other end of the question"
- Poetry and support writing share the same discipline: be concise while reaching something larger; clarity and engagement at the same time

- Frame requests and disagreements from the organization's perspective, not "I want X" — managers and stakeholders must justify decisions to the org, so meeting them at that framing makes conversations more effective
- Use the same matter-of-fact collaborative tone for sensitive topics ("I have a concern about X") as you would for routine ones ("the software isn't working") — treating a difficult conversation as emotionally exceptional before it begins signals fragility and often escalates it
- Employees systematically underestimate how much good managers want to hear from them — speaking up early and directly is almost always welcomed by capable managers and builds career credibility faster than waiting

## Co-founder and Stakeholder Disagreements

- Disagree and commit is an explicit named tactic at 37signals: after a debate, the less passionate party states "I don't agree, but I commit to whatever we decide" — naming the tactic made it easier to actually use it
- Measure disagreements by who cares more, not by who argues better — when passion is lopsided, the more passionate person's preference gets the try; this resolves most ties without compromise-by-averaging
- Avoid the words "always" and "never" in a disagreement — their appearance signals the conversation has shifted from merits to personal labeling, and you need to pull it back to the substance
- Most decisions are reversible — treat them as experiments with a defined check-in period rather than permanent commitments that require winning the argument now
- A healthy debate on the merits should end with both parties able to go for a drink afterward; if the personal relationship is strained, the argument went off the rails before the conclusion
- With 10,000 debates behind you, the data says you're wrong a meaningful fraction of the time — calibrate confidence accordingly; humility about past wrongness makes committing to someone else's call psychologically easier
- Don't ask investor or partner permission before announcing a decision — make the decision, then inform stakeholders the day it goes live; asking permission transfers veto power you don't need to give away

- Avoid making reactive secondary decisions in the fog of a major stressful decision — when under pressure, you slip and make permanent calls you wouldn't make calmly; after a big company decision, pause before acting on every subsequent impulse it generates
- Project one year ahead as a filter for in-the-moment choices: "how will this feel in 12 months?" correctly deprioritizes the pain of the present and aligns you with the outcome you actually want

## Job Ads and Hiring Communication

- Job ads are the clearest signal of a company's actual culture — read them for what the company brags about (money raised, passion, after-hours activities) to identify calm vs. chaotic workplaces before applying
- "Hard work" in a job posting is always a euphemism for overwork — no one uses the phrase to mean 40 hours a week; treat it as a warning marker
- Write job ads that describe what the person would have done last week had they held the role — specificity draws people who care about the actual work, not the abstract title
- Vague principles in job ads ("we value teamwork") are non-filters; a real principle must be something another company would disagree with, otherwise it does not discriminate between you and everyone else
- The tone and voice of a job ad communicates culture as directly as its content — a candidate who wants a buttoned-up corporate environment will self-select out after reading a 37signals job ad; this is the desired outcome
- Remote-first hiring is a communication force-multiplier: opening roles globally produces hundreds or thousands of applicants vs. a thin local pool, giving you enough signal to identify genuine principle-alignment

## Advice, Input, and Decision Confidence

- Advice has an expiration date — Jason and David are the wrong people to ask about starting a business because they haven't done it in 20 years; seek out someone who started one six months ago for current, actionable experience
- Asking more people produces more uncertainty, not more clarity — if you want to feel less sure about your direction, ask five more people; at some point you must commit to your gut
- Ignore more advice than you take — collecting mentors like trading cards is counterproductive; too many inputs crowd out the internal voice that actually has to make the decision
- Internet reviews distort reality: only extreme experiences (the one broken sauna out of 50,000, the one perfect one) get written up; the vast silent majority who found something "fine" never publishes; therefore the review landscape makes every ordinary decision feel high-stakes when it isn't
- Comparison-shopping paralysis is a form of procrastination — the time spent researching gear is time not spent doing the work; ask one trusted person what to buy, buy that, and move on
- Taking the same inputs as everyone else in your circle produces outputs similar to theirs — originality requires cultivating different sources, including deliberately uncomfortable or historically distant ones
- The most useful mentors are often dead ones: books survive their authors precisely because the ideas had to stand alone; a dead author cannot dazzle you with personality or podcast presence — only the insight remains, and you must translate it to your context yourself, which personalizes and internalizes it
- Prefer reality as a mentor over accumulated advice — throw the ball and see how it bounces; the first throw gives you more corrective information than extended pre-throw analysis, and most decisions give you multiple throws before the game is over
- The real function of good advice is often permission, not information — the reader usually already holds the correct instinct; the adviser's job is to confirm that the instinct is not crazy and encourage action
- Keep a short list of 50 core principles rather than accumulating thousands — having 10,000 ideas in your head makes it impossible to know which one to apply; the constraint forces synthesis and actually increases decisiveness
- Successful people often cannot accurately explain what made them successful — survivorship bias, timing, and compounding small accidents are invisible; copying their stated strategy without their context produces a worse copy, not a similar outcome

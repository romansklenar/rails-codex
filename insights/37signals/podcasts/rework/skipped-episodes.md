# Skipped Episodes

Episodes not included in the thematic insight files, with the reason why. Do not re-analyse these in future passes.

---

## Replays & duplicate slugs

Exact replays of episodes already cited, or malformed slugs pointing to the same content.

- **building-to-flip-replay** — replay of `building-to-flip-is-building-to-flop` (already cited)
- **planning-is--guessing** — double-dash typo slug; content is identical to `planning-is-guessing` (already cited)
- **scratch-your-own-itch-replay** — replay of `scratch-your-own-itch` (already cited)
- **you-need-less-than-you-think-season-2** — Season 2 re-recording of `you-need-less-than-you-think` (already cited); no materially new content

---

## Company moments & farewell episodes

Internal milestones, office moves, and tribute episodes. No transferable insights.

- **a-dumpster-fire-of-a-year** — year-end team reflection on a difficult year; personal not tactical
- **end-of-year-junk-drawer** — end-of-year listicle, no coherent theme
- **farewell-happy-camper** — goodbye to a departing employee
- **farewell-noah** — goodbye to Noah Lorang (data/ops lead)
- **farewell-west-loop** — farewell to the Chicago office space
- **greetings-from-mojito-island** — company meet-up travelogue
- **return-to-mojito-island** — second meet-up travelogue
- **revisiting-the-good-old-days** — nostalgic retrospective, no actionable content
- **you-never-forget-george-pappageorge** — tribute to a local Chicago personality; no business content

---

## Conference talks & appearances on other shows

Recordings of external talks or DHH/Jason appearing as guests elsewhere. Content is largely recaps of ideas already well-represented in other episodes.

- **culturati-summit-2018** — Jason's talk at a culture conference; reiterates work-culture principles already covered
- **dhh-on-the-heartbeat-podcast** — DHH as a guest on another podcast; no new ideas beyond what's in thematic files
- **jason-fried-industry-2017** — Jason's talk at Industry conference; overlaps heavily with Shape Up and communication content already captured
- **jason-fried-todo-notifications** — short talk on notifications; tangential, not enough new material

---

## Behind-the-scenes & meta episodes

Episodes about making the podcast itself or reflecting on past content.

- **behind-the-scenes-of-the-rework-podcast** — hosts discussing how the show is produced; no business insights
- **reblog** — a blog post read aloud verbatim; content already covered in blog insight files

---

## External guest business stories

Interviews with non-37signals founders about their own companies. Interesting but insights don't generalise to the 37signals playbook; nothing to add to existing thematic files.

- **bean-machine** — Chicago coffee shop
- **bookshop-around-the-corner** — bookshop.org origin story
- **breadcamp** — artisan bakery
- **bubble-wrap-prayers** — small retail business
- **can-you-sell-water-1** / **can-you-sell-water-2** — premium water brand
- **coops-next-generation** — worker-owned co-operatives
- **exit-to-community** — community ownership model for tech companies
- **from-insolvency-to-upsolve** — legal-aid startup; different domain
- **life-after-shark-tank** — consumer product company post-Shark Tank
- **long-time-snacker** — snack food company
- **rug-life** — rug/textile business
- **slow-fashion** — sustainable fashion brand
- **the-humble-fungus** — mushroom cultivation business
- **when-chris-met-mark** — origin story of an external partnership
- **you-had-me-at-hylo** — Hylo community platform; different product philosophy

---

## Personal narrative episodes

Guest conversations or personal stories that don't yield transferable business tactics.

- **email-changed-my-life** — listeners share personal stories about a meaningful email; no business insight
- **living-on-hope** — profile of a former 37signals employee living on a sailboat; lifestyle not tactics
- **phone-a-friend** — COVID-era check-in conversation with a theologian/coffee roaster; no applicable content
- **unplugged-from-the-matrix** — entrepreneurship profile of Kenneth Coats; anecdotal, the one insight ("burn your ships") is not actionable

---

## Low-signal Q&A / mailbag

These episodes are grab-bag listener questions. Anything substantive from them has been extracted via the more focused Q&A episodes already in the thematic files (e.g. `listener-questions`, `managing-chaos-listener-qs`).

- **mailbag-1-2** — mixed questions, low signal density
- **mailbag-2** — mixed questions, low signal density
- **rapid-fire-with-jason-david** — rapid-fire trivia/opinion format; no tactical depth
- **rework-mailbag-4** — mixed listener questions; nothing not already covered
- **rework-mailbag-5** — mixed listener questions; nothing not already covered

---

## Content already covered by adjacent episodes

Transcripts with real content that was assessed by agents and found to duplicate material already in thematic files.

- **a-matter-of-ambition-part-2** — continues the ambition series; Part 1 and the core ideas are already in `product-development.md`
- **before-basecamp** — VC/dot-com era history; no new marketing tactics beyond what's in thematic files
- **better-product-adam-stoddard** — brand and marketing design critique (messaging-first, SVG assets, Lighthouse scores); relevant to a brand/design file that doesn't yet exist, not to `founder-leadership.md`
- **breaking-the-black-box** — DHH's Apple Card credit-limit Twitter controversy and algorithmic bias in fintech; no applicable insight for existing thematic files
- **dan-miller** — finance/operations model for a direct-response business; not marketing
- **know-your-team** — origin story of the Know Your Team spinoff (now Canopy); already captured in `business-philosophy.md` via the spinoff section
- **poetry-at-work** — the parallel between support writing and poetry is already in `communication.md`; the rest is a literary/cultural episode
- **start-making-something-season-2** — Season 2 version; overlaps with `start-making-something` (already cited)
- **the-new-reality** — Jason and David reflecting on the REWORK book and Rails history during COVID; meta-commentary, not new tactics
- **this-time-its-personal** — DHH discussing his personal situation during the political controversy period; situational, not tactical
- **truss-the-process** — salary transparency experiment at an external company (Wildbit); the 37signals-specific compensation model is already in `hiring.md`
- **work-out-from-home** — COVID small business pivots; no new remote-work tactics for existing sections

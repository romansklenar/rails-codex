# Business Philosophy

## Identity & Values

- Mission statements fail because they contain no tradeoffs — a value statement that everyone in the world would agree with is not a value statement, it's a list of pleasant-sounding sentences; the test of a real value is whether it would turn some people off; no mission statement ever written would turn anyone off
- A mission statement that contradicts visible reality is actively harmful — a crooked clipart printout on a dirty rental car office wall quoting commitments to "exceptional personalized service" doesn't express aspiration; it broadcasts that the organization is either deluded or lying; the gap between the statement and the experience is worse than silence
- Hundreds of specific, opinionated essays beat eight abstract values — 37signals tried distilling its beliefs into eight handbook entries; the result sounded nice but couldn't actually drive decisions in context; the hundreds of concrete Signal v. Noise posts and essays, each taking a narrow, contestable position, communicated the actual worldview far more precisely
- Your tagline should be written by a disinterested customer, not your marketing team — asking customers what a product does strips away the self-congratulatory framing and reveals the plain transactional truth ("Basecamp covers your ass"); that truth is more memorable and useful than anything crafted internally
- Actions reveal values; statements don't — whether a rental car company cares about customers is visible in whether someone is at the counter, whether the car is clean, and whether the hold music lies about your call's importance; no amount of mission statement language changes any of those signals
- The "serial entrepreneur" framing treats companies as temporary — the assumption embedded in "what's next?" is that the current business is a stepping stone; founders who define themselves by this identity build with shortcuts, transfer problems to the next owner, and leave the world slightly worse; the alternative identity is simply: I own a business, I make things, that's it
- **Saying no is a values test, not just a product decision**: the things you say no to define what you stand for more clearly than the things you say yes to; a business that says yes to every customer request, every pricing tier, and every product direction has no character; refusal is where identity becomes visible

## Independence & Profit

- Profit enables optionality, not just revenue — profitability means you can give a product away for free on a whim (Writebook), reverse a growth decision, or skip a lucrative opportunity you don't want; optionality is the meta-outcome above all other business metrics
- Your real competition is your own cost structure, not other products — HEY with tens of thousands of paying customers is a success; the same number would be failure at Google; stop watching competitors, control what you can control
- Taking outside money is Plan Z — specifically because it eliminates optionality; VC money locks you into a single lane: rapid growth toward IPO or acquisition; you internalize goals you didn't choose
- Building to flip is building to flop — a flip mindset produces spec-house quality: looks good on a term sheet, built with shortcuts, delivered with a known expiration date; customers deserve software the founders intend to live in long-term
- "Startup" is a costume that lets you suspend basic economics — a new business that doesn't have a path to profit is a financial instrument, not a business; just call it a business and act accordingly from day one
- You need less than you think to start — 37signals launched Basecamp with no billing system (one-month free trial bought time to build one), no office (borrowed desk space), and a friend-of-Jason's-mom as accountant; the startup tax of fancy infrastructure is mostly invented
- Growth should be questioned, not assumed — the right question is always "why grow?" not "how fast?"; size should serve the work, not ambition
- Small businesses are the core customer and the kindred spirit — 37signals targets the Fortune 5 million, not the Fortune 500; no salespeople, no enterprise pricing, no long sales cycles, and that's deliberate
- Continuous profit-taking off the table reduces eventual regret — taking distributions every year means the company can end and the founders don't start from zero; "no one ever went broke taking a profit"
- Cost scrutiny is an aesthetic, not just accounting — AWS at 30% of HEY's $100 revenue per user was "disproportionate"; Datadog at $83K/year for partially optional analytics was "preposterous"; the smell test: would I spend my own money on this?

- Success is surviving, not maximizing — Heath Ceramics' explicit goal is a 200-year lifespan; the measure of success is still being around through cycles, not hitting an ROI multiple or exit; "if you're surviving, and you're still doing well" is the bar
- Optionality is highest before any funding decision — once liquidation preferences exist (e.g. $16.5M before founders see a dollar), the founder's motivation to continue collapses; the moment to protect optionality is before the first check, not after
- Payroll changes the game irreversibly — the moment you have employees depending on a paycheck, the psychological stakes shift entirely; missing payroll, even once due to a clerical error, is one of the worst things a founder can experience; that weight is permanent
- VC structural pressure is implicit, not explicit — investors rarely issue direct ultimatums; the pressure is built into the system: board seats, growth targets, liquidity timelines, and social exclusion from the ecosystem if you're not performing on the unicorn trajectory
- The minority/no-control deal structure is the only acceptable form of outside investment — the Bezos/Basecamp deal's two defining terms were minority stake and no control to force any particular decision; both conditions must hold simultaneously or independence is compromised
- Customers' anxiety about ownership changes is rational — users of bootstrapped software feel a personal connection to the founders' values; when ownership changes, that connection severs and trust erodes, which is why announcing VC raises triggers immediate public backlash from loyal users

- "Entrepreneur" is a gatekeeping word loaded with exclusionary baggage — the definition implies 80-hour weeks, massive risk, and capital-raising; that definition filters out most people who could and should start a business; replacing it with "starter" didn't catch on, but the critique stands: starting something is not the hard part, surviving is
- Serial entrepreneur is the worst archetype — the "what's next?" assumption treats every business as a temporary financial instrument on the way to the next flip; founders who could just as easily sell milk as software reveal through that attitude that they don't actually care about what they build
- Craft and enthusiasm are visible in the product — companies run by enthusiasts (watchmakers, independent coffee grinder builders, Saddleback Leather) produce things that are obviously overbuilt in ways no commercial calculus would justify; customers who share that enthusiasm seek these products out and pay premium prices; the quality of caring shows
- The baker should run the bakery — "The E-Myth" argument (a baker is the worst person to run a bakery because they'll care too much about flour quality) inverts cause and effect; Toyota became one of the world's largest car companies precisely because engineers ran it and anyone on the assembly line could stop production if something was wrong
- Validation before product is always cheaper than product before validation — launching a website with a screenshot of a mocked-up product, posting on BetaList, and messaging LinkedIn strangers to gauge interest costs nothing and reveals market demand before a dollar is spent on manufacturing or development
- The gig economy's exploitation mechanism is asset liquidation disguised as flexibility — gig platforms don't pay workers while idle between jobs, don't cover vehicle depreciation or maintenance, and don't account for the 40% of drive time with no passenger; the "make money on the side" pitch works only for the first month before true costs materialize; 100% annual driver churn is the proof that the economics don't hold
- Healthcare and education fail under pure market economics because need, not preference, drives demand — you are not "in the market" for healthcare when you are dying; private US healthcare at 18% of GDP delivers worse life expectancy and more medical bankruptcies than state-run Danish healthcare at 8% of GDP; the comparison is a controlled experiment with a clear result
- Tying health insurance to employment is the worst of all systems — it traps workers in jobs they want to leave, blocks candidates from joining startups that can't afford premium benefits, and creates an anti-market distortion in labor mobility that no free-market advocate should endorse
- Social mobility in the US is among the lowest in the Western world — the American dream is statistically false: people born in the bottom quintile are more likely to stay there than in Denmark, Germany, or Canada; anecdotes of exceptional individuals are not evidence that the system works, only that exceptions exist
- Philanthropy does not substitute for structural reform — writing a check for a university wing after a career of suppressing wages and opposing tax reform is a redistribution mechanism with the donor in control of where the money goes; structural taxation with democratic allocation is categorically different and more effective at scale
- Email tracking pixels are surveillance by default and require explicit recipient consent to be ethical — Superhuman's implementation reported back to senders the recipient's open time, location, and open count without any notification; consent-based read receipts (opt-in, bilateral) are the only defensible model; DHH blocked tracking pixels in HEY after discovering Basecamp's own MailChimp integration was doing the same

## Ignoring the Competition

- Chasing competitors is almost always a mistake because you will be second — copying output without copying the thinking behind it yields a derivative product with no original insight; it only works in pure commodity markets where price is the only variable, and most businesses worth discussing are not commodity markets
- Ignoring the competition does not mean ignoring your customers — customers are occasionally excited about something a competitor does because the competitor solved something real; stay tuned to customer desire, not to competitor moves
- Competition-watching functions as procrastination — it gives you a credible-sounding reason to be afraid and a credible-sounding reason not to do something; if you're looking for an excuse to stall, the competitor list will supply an endless stream of them
- "The competition doesn't pay us anything; I worry about the people who pay us" (Bezos) — customers fund the business; competitors consume attention without contributing to it; the incentive system points clearly at where attention belongs
- Ignoring competitors does not mean beating them — 37signals has competitors with more revenue, more employees, and more customers; "winning" is defined by what you want: a great product, sustainable work, happy employees, and happy customers; by that definition you can ignore the competition and succeed
- Stoic focus on what you control is the operating principle — competitors' moves are entirely outside your control; your own talents, resources, voice, audience, existing software, and angle are within your control; bet on the controllable variables, not the uncontrollable ones
- No guarantee either way — ignoring or watching competitors does not guarantee success; odds of going out of business are always present regardless of strategy; the argument for ignoring them is about efficiency of effort and quality of output, not certainty of outcome
- Following a competitor's marketing strategy means following someone who may be losing money in ways you cannot see — ClickUp and Monday plaster ads everywhere while losing hundreds of millions per year; the visible surface of a competitor's strategy tells you nothing about whether it is working
- Technology does not move as fast as the panic suggests — in 30 years there have been three genuine paradigm shifts: the internet (~1995), the smartphone (iPhone, 2007), and AI (~2023–); everything else was incremental, a fad, or part of the fabric; the HTML page written in 1995 still works today; skills learned then mostly still apply; calibrate urgency to actual magnitude, not media volume
- AI is the third major paradigm shift, on the level of mobile and the internet — acknowledging that is different from panic-chasing every AI feature announcement; the magnitude of the shift justifies serious engagement, not reactive feature-stuffing
- Generational change is not a threat to resist — a 22-year-old approaching a problem without your legacy of imprints will see it differently; that different vantage produces genuinely new solutions, not just re-skins; the market regularly discovers that "solved problems" were not fully solved when someone revisits them with fresh eyes
- "Not invented here" syndrome is mostly bullshit — revisiting a problem someone else has already solved produces new solutions a hundred times out of a hundred because fresh context reveals what was missed; age and context are legitimate competitive advantages even in mature problem spaces
- Ignorance of conventions is a startup superpower — the belief that you can do something in a weekend that actually takes months is what propels the start; once started, momentum builds and learning follows; the delusion is fuel, not a defect
- Experienced founders should not try to out-compete younger ones on their own terms — stamina, speed, and raw cultural fluency favor the young; the offset is crystallized intelligence and pattern recognition; lean into what age actually gives you rather than pretending it hasn't arrived
- Authentic self is more sustainable than performance — acting like something you're not works in the short term but erodes; your true nature shows through; if the business requires you to be a persona you don't actually hold, it will not last and you will not be happy while it's lasting
- Mentorship is overrated as a one-on-one institution — any founder capable of articulating what they've learned is already sharing it publicly (books, podcasts, essays, tweets); the secret stash of private wisdom that only unlocks with a personal relationship does not exist; learn from afar, sample widely, then go off on your own
- Confidence is the one thing a mentor relationship can provide that public content cannot — having someone credible say "I believe in this, go" is worth something; that is not the same as exclusive wisdom; the wisdom is already distributed, the signal is the belief in you specifically

## Product Strategy

- ONCE is a direct response to subscription overload — customers pay perpetual monthly fees for software that is essentially identical month to month; ONCE restores the product model: pay once, get the source, install on your own server, own it indefinitely
- Each ONCE product must be buildable by two people in a few months — the constraint forces radical scope discipline and proves that small teams can ship complete, commercial-quality software
- Including source code with the product is a deliberate statement — buyers can inspect exactly what the software does, audit privacy behavior, and run it indefinitely even if 37signals disappeared; source-included software is analogous to watchmakers who publish their movements
- SaaS and ONCE can coexist in the same product (Fizzy model) — the "O'Saasy" license: full open source rights except the right to run it as a competing SaaS; enables community collaboration while preserving a commercial SaaS tier
- Maintain products until the end of the internet — including ones that make no money; Tada List, a free to-do app from 2005, received zero material updates since 2006 but 37signals migrated it through four hosting environments rather than shut it down; principles have to cost something to mean something
- Never sell new customers into a product you're not actively developing — Backpack, Highrise, and Basecamp Classic are in "heritage mode": existing customers can stay forever, new signups not accepted
- Product spinoffs work cleanest when the cut is clean — Know Your Company (now Canopy) was spun off with a one-page agreement: 50/50 split until $1M revenue, then 75/25 in the operator's favor; the simpler the deal, the more likely it gets honored
- The Google Graveyard is a competitive advantage for 37signals — Google has killed 447+ products; every kill plants doubt about all Google products; "Can you trust us?" is answered by 20+ years of keeping every product running; brand longevity can't be engineered in, only accumulated
- The right size for a product portfolio depends on how many products you can maintain at high quality — in 2014, four products with 16 people meant cutting to one; in 2021, two large products meant roughly doubling headcount; the calculus is capability, not ambition

- Easy cancellation is a trust signal, not a revenue risk — companies that force phone calls, hold queues, or scripted retention loops to cancel a subscription are revealing that they don't believe their product is worth paying for; the businesses that allow one-click cancellation attract and retain customers who actually want to be there
- Subscription hostage tactics are a dark pattern with a name — requiring customers to "discuss" cancellation, restricting online cancellation to specific jurisdictions, or only offering cancellation within a narrow call-center window are legally challengeable and ethically indefensible; California's 2017 legislation mandated online cancellation for any service that allows online signup
- A product that can't retain customers on merit will eventually trap them or lose them — the retention game played through friction (dark patterns) is a losing long-term strategy; the alternative is making something worth $59/year that people renew without thinking about it
- Self-competing products within your own portfolio are acceptable — when two products you own serve different use cases with different "grips," you don't need to fear internal competition; if the customer chooses your other product, you still win

- "Done for you" and "done for others" are different products — HEY for Work ran internally at Basecamp for most of its two-year development cycle; when it was ready for the public, months of additional "finishing carpentry" remained: signup flows, onboarding screens, edge cases that internal users had manually worked around; this gap exists for every internal tool turned product
- You don't need all the customers — HEY for Work targeting tens of thousands of small companies is a deliberate success definition; a startup needing to show massive traction in 18 months would rationally avoid competing with Gmail and Outlook; 37signals can play an infinite game because it doesn't owe investors a specific exit timeline
- Slow cohort rollouts reveal real problems before they compound — launching HEY for Work by inviting companies of 1–5 first, then 6–10, then 11–20 meant each wave's support load was manageable; unexpected requests (catch-all addresses, journaling/forwarding for legal compliance) surfaced before they became crises at scale
- Kickstarter's meritocracy illusion is gone — in the early days, a good product could surface organically through Kickstarter's editorial picks; by 2018, campaigns required $25K video budgets, pre-lined-up press, knowledge of the platform's editorial calendar, and blogger payments; the platform shifted from discovery engine to pay-to-play marketing channel; a failed campaign doesn't mean a failed product
- Manufacturing partners should argue with you — a partner who shrugs and makes what you asked for without pushback produces what you designed, not what's actually manufacturable; a partner who says "why did you do it this way?" makes a better product and transfers knowledge to the designer

## Open Source & Technology

- Open source is a moral and practical obligation, not a marketing strategy — 37signals was built entirely on open source (Linux, Ruby, PostgreSQL); giving back isn't charity, it's repaying the infrastructure that made it possible to start a software company without a database license fee
- Ruby on Rails was open-sourced because the investment was already made — the marginal cost of releasing it was near zero; the benefit (external contributors, talent pipeline, community standing) was enormous; this is the core economic logic for all 37signals open source: we had to build it anyway
- Publishing source code raises internal quality standards — knowing others will inspect the code changes how you write it: cleaner structure, fewer shortcuts, more intentional design decisions; open source is a forcing function for craftsmanship
- Dropping TypeScript from Turbo 8 was a principled tool preference, not a political statement — the team wasn't enjoying writing TypeScript; a programmer removed it in 40 minutes; the internet storm was predictable but the decision stood anyway
- DHH moved from Apple to Linux after 23 years because values alignment matters more than comfort — Apple blocked app distribution without permission, extracted 30% of revenue, and treated developers as adversaries; Framework laptops (user-repairable, modular hardware) align with the same principles
- Omarchy is the Linux onboarding experience 37signals wanted — rather than asking developers to spend two months configuring Linux themselves, DHH packaged his own optimized Arch Linux setup and released it publicly
- 37signals is intentionally multi-platform: Apple, Windows, and Linux — more than half of Basecamp users run Windows; a company building for customers should see what customers see
- The open source commitment extends to commercial products — Fizzy (open source SaaS tool) and the ONCE line (source-included purchases) both reject the idea that competitive advantage requires keeping code secret; the competitive moat is craft and execution, not obscurity
- Support everything you release, no strings attached — Turbo, Hotwire, Rails, Kamal: all MIT licensed, all maintained with company resources, all available without licensing fees or revenue cuts

- Platform dependency is an existential risk — building your entire audience on Twitter, Substack, or any third-party platform means you can be deplatformed, algorithmically suppressed, or simply made irrelevant by the platform's business decisions; HEY World was built explicitly so authors own their subscriber email addresses, not a platform
- Web 1.0 principles are a product philosophy, not just an aesthetic — no JavaScript, no tracking, no cookies, no infinite scroll, no algorithmic amplification; these constraints enforce privacy, speed, and independence by design rather than as add-on features
- "Active safety" is better than moderating at scale — designing a product that doesn't amplify content is structurally safer than hiring 30,000 moderators to clean up what amplification creates; a typewriter company isn't responsible for what people type; a publisher of op-eds is; the product model determines the liability
- Feature comparison charts are the worst way to select software — a feature checklist will always favor the product with more checkboxes, which is usually the most complex and least enjoyable to use; the only reliable selection method is a 10-minute test drive to feel whether the grip is right
- Aesthetics are a legitimate first-order product criterion — in every other domain (cars, clothing, cutlery), people freely admit they chose something because of how it looks or feels; software should be no different; surrounding yourself with products that give you joy is a genuine quality-of-life variable, not a frivolous one
- AI should not ship until accuracy exceeds end-user tolerance — a developer can productively use a tool that's right 80% of the time; an end-user will hate a tool that's wrong 1 in 5 times; shipping AI features before they clear the tolerance threshold is self-defeating and generates lasting brand damage
- Employee ownership (ESOP) is a succession plan, not just a benefit — Heath Ceramics chose an ESOP specifically to solve the succession problem that almost killed the original company; the structure gives employees a retirement stake, preserves company direction, and prevents a sale-driven pivot away from founding values

- AI FOMO is manufactured and counterproductive — the "you're already falling behind" framing on LinkedIn and Twitter is a pressure tactic, not an accurate description of competitive risk; the half-life of being an AI expert is roughly 48 hours given the rate of model and tooling changes; a late adopter can catch up almost immediately
- Treat AI with curiosity, not fear or urgency — the most productive early stance is playful experimentation (Midjourney for images, ChatGPT for text prompts) rather than rushed feature integration; the businesses adding AI to summarize documents are implementing the most boring possible use of the technology
- Thin wrappers on OpenAI APIs are not products — dozens of "AI startups" consist entirely of an API call plus a UI; OpenAI shipping its own app eliminated them overnight; pennies-in-front-of-a-steamroller economics apply to any startup whose competitive advantage is API access to someone else's model
- Confidential data and AI services don't mix safely — prompts sent to commercial AI services go into a database; what happens to that database is governed by terms that can change, employees who can access it, and security teams that can be breached; treat AI input the same way you'd treat a web form: don't type anything you wouldn't want leaked
- Accessibility built in from the start costs a fraction of what retrofitting costs — starting accessibility work midway through a product's lifecycle means every new feature is accessible but a permanent backlog of inaccessible legacy UI exists; starting from scratch (as with HEY) allows the team to ship with a clear sense of what's good and what needs work rather than a fog of unknown debt
- Designing for accessibility makes the product better for everyone — keyboard shortcuts added for screen reader users gave all HEY users faster navigation; autocomplete pickers that announce result counts clearly help sighted users track state too; the WCAG principle that "designing for accessibility results in better features for all users" holds empirically
- Small accessibility changes produce disproportionate impact — relabeling a button from "Write" to "Write a new message" costs one line of code and costs nothing visually, but transforms the experience for a screen reader user who might have misread the instruction as directional; labeling buttons and assets correctly is the highest-ROI accessibility intervention available
- 15% of web users have some form of disability — that's not an edge case, it's a sizable market segment; companies that don't build accessibly are voluntarily excluding a large customer cohort and exposing themselves to legal and reputational risk, especially in workplace software where employees don't have the option to simply switch products

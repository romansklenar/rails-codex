# Marketing & Growth

## Why Paid Advertising Fails Small Businesses

- Three serious attempts at paid ads over 25 years — none achieved break-even; cost-per-acquisition was "astronomical"
- Branded keyword buys on Google cannibalize organic clicks almost entirely — eBay ran millions in branded search, turned it off accidentally, nothing changed
- Software-as-service requires organizational buy-in, not impulse buying; ads work for sneakers and games, not collaborative tools
- Lifetime value at 37signals pricing (flat fee or low per-seat) is incompatible with $3,000–$20,000 customer acquisition costs typical of enterprise ad campaigns
- Brand advertising is hard to measure — running it for quarters and looking for overall lift shows no reliable signal because organic brand-building already does the heavy lifting
- Performance marketing channels (Meta, Google) take 90–97 cents on the dollar — the economic split feels wrong even when marginally profitable
- The only ad that generated measurable ROI was a provocative stance ad (calling out Google's practice of selling branded keywords to competitors), which went viral organically and landed DHH on CNBC — the idea beat the product pitch
- Conclusion: test paid channels rigorously, measure incrementality not just conversions, accept the result if economics don't work after multiple attempts

## Founder-Led Marketing: What It Actually Is

- Marketing at 37signals is not a strategy — it is a side effect of sharing things Jason and David genuinely care about; planning for marketing outcomes is the fastest way to produce fake-sounding output
- "Marketing is a transfer of enthusiasm" — if the founder isn't genuinely excited, no audience will be either
- Founders have personal credibility on the line in a way brands never do; it creates an authenticity pressure that forces quality
- DHH writing 500+ essays on HEY World, Jason posting product design decisions on social — these are driven by desire to share, not content calendars
- The term "content marketing" signals MBA-style instrumentalism; producing "content" to hit a quota is indistinguishable from spam to the audience
- Audience capture via algorithm is a real risk — the for-you feed rewards spicy takes and pushes toward a character, not the person
- Large follower counts with 17 likes per post = ghost audience bought or accumulated through tactics; an earned audience of 5,000 who actually buys is worth more than 500,000 disengaged followers
- DHH's HEY World mailing list generates 7 deep email replies per essay vs. thousands of shallow social interactions — the email exchanges are what he actually remembers; email replies are the Don Shanks of the modern era
- Jason's self-check: "If I didn't work here, would I ever spend another second on LinkedIn?" Honest answer: no — but he does it because it's part of the job

## Teaching as the Core Marketing Mechanism

- "Out-teach your competition" — sharing behind-the-scenes decisions, code samples, design choices, and business reasoning earns attention that ads can't buy
- The connection earned by genuinely teaching someone something is deeper and more durable than anything an ad impression creates
- Customers who've read 37signals writing for years arrive already aligned — "I signed up for Basecamp yesterday, I've been reading your stuff for five years" — no ad produces that relationship
- Teaching is free in the sense of not requiring ad spend, but it requires founders to remain intimately involved in building so their lessons are concrete and real
- 37signals wrote Getting Real (2006) and ran the "Building Basecamp" eight-hour seminar just one year after Basecamp launched — teaching was the launch strategy from day one
- The developer blog (dev.37signals.com) publishes actual code from commercial products, not abstract advice — this transparency is rare and magnetic to technical audiences
- Fear of sharing "secrets" is unfounded: execution and timing determine success, not code snippets; treat your company like a restaurant that also publishes a cookbook
- Don't share lessons as "seven tips" SEO bait — share only what genuinely interests the author; inauthentic educational content is worse than no content
- Sharing doesn't require production values — a 10-minute post written and shipped same-day captures freshness that a polished article scheduled two weeks out loses

## Blogging and Written Content

- Signal vs. Noise blog started in 1999 with no audience strategy — three people sharing internally decided to publish externally; the blog pre-dates the word "blog"
- No analytics in the early days was an advantage: without follower counts staring back, writing stayed authentic and enthusiasm drove output rather than metrics
- REWORK the book wrote itself — it is a curated by-product of years of blog posts, tightened and unified; it was never conceived as a book project
- Content schedules kill content: writing because it's Tuesday at 9am means you've already lost; the best posts emerge from inspiration, not cadence
- Don't measure blog ROI early — no audience exists at the start, so any metric looks terrible and will kill the habit before compounding begins
- Blogging builds credibility with compounding returns: 25 years of consistent sharing is why a single NYT feature or Lex Fridman episode caused a sustained measurable spike in signups — the media appearance amplifies an existing base, it doesn't create one
- Tech blog best practice: publish actual code from your commercial codebase, share real crises and how you navigated them, let any employee write without assignment or editorial approval, enforce no publishing cadence
- Every blog post lives forever — a post from 2016 still acquires readers in 2026; the cost is paid once, the value compounds indefinitely

## Audience Building

- An audience is people who come back to see what you have to say — distinct from people you've paid to reach once
- Build by sharing and giving with no expectation of return; occasional asks (product launches, new features) land only because the ratio of giving to asking is heavily weighted toward giving
- Audience building requires patience measured in years, but requires urgent impatience to share ideas the moment they arrive — inspiration is perishable
- Starting from zero audience is the right condition — you build exposure tolerance gradually; going from zero to one million overnight would be psychologically destructive
- Document, don't create: you're making decisions every day, so write up what you decided and why — this costs almost nothing extra and produces genuine content
- Respond directly: Jason and DHH are reachable by email, reply on social, engage in arguments — the "faceless brand" problem is solved by simply showing up as a person
- Small companies have a structural advantage: the founder who makes decisions can also explain them in real time, which large companies cannot replicate at speed or authenticity
- Avoid scheduling tools for social posts — when you auto-schedule, you're not there to respond, turning posts into monologues and destroying community-building value
- Polarizing opinions accelerate audience formation: people who love your takes and people who hate them are both more useful than indifferent followers

## Selling By-Products

- Everything a company does creates by-products; spotting and packaging them is a low-cost growth channel that requires no additional core investment
- The Signal vs. Noise blog → Building Basecamp seminar → Getting Real PDF → REWORK book → ongoing workshops: each product fed the next without requiring a new strategy
- Getting Real was self-published as a $19 PDF with the buyer's name watermarked on each page — a simple piracy disincentive that made the business model tangible without DRM
- Workshops: run them when there's genuine enthusiasm, raise prices each time they sell out, stop when bored, restart when excited — no fixed schedule required
- Speaking and interviews are by-products: every talk and podcast conversation surfaces new angles that become blog posts or book chapters — Jason explicitly uses interviews to discover new ideas
- Spinoff products (Ta-Da List, Breeze) came from watching customers use Basecamp for things it wasn't designed for, then extracting that use case into its own product
- The test for a by-product's value: put a price on it and see if people trade money for it; free reception doesn't confirm value the way a purchase does
- By-product monetization works best when the core product has healthy margin — the extra revenue from books and workshops is bonus, not load-bearing

## Free Plans and Conversion Strategy

- Free tier rationale: exposure drives organic growth for a product that sells itself once used — Basecamp converts through actual usage, not advertising
- Basecamp had a free one-project plan at launch, removed it in 2015 (short-term paid conversions improved), brought it back after recognizing that reduced exposure compounded negatively over years
- MailChimp's head of marketing credited their free plan as the single biggest inflection in their growth trajectory — that anecdote directly triggered the decision to reintroduce free at Basecamp
- Reintroducing free more than doubled weekly signups; early conversion rate held stable — the bet is measured on a 2–5 year horizon, not quarterly
- Free plan design: one-project limit but unlimited collaborators — the viral mechanism is guests receiving invitations to someone else's free Basecamp, then becoming users themselves
- HEY cannot easily offer free tiers: each email account costs real server money and the namespace creates permanent address allocation problems that Basecamp's project model doesn't have
- A/B testing cadence: look at weekly aggregates, not daily; tests need weeks to reach significance, and early peeking produces false winners
- "Ask reality for an answer" — run the test rather than relying on results from years ago; markets, products, and customers change enough to invalidate historical A/B data
- Presenting the most expensive plan first on pricing pages tested better for plan mix — but this finding doesn't transfer across industries or even across time for the same product

## Metrics and What to Measure

- Vanity metrics (follower counts, impressions, raw clicks) don't map to business outcomes for a low-price, high-consideration product like Basecamp
- Aggregate trajectory over months and years matters more than any single spike — individual viral moments are exciting but the baseline moving average is what sustains the business
- Spikes from media appearances (DHH on Lex Fridman, Jason's NYT feature with Ezra Klein) produced measurable and sustained baseline lifts — but you can't plan for spikes; you build the base that makes spikes matter
- Incremental analysis is the only honest metric for paid advertising — compare performance against the counterfactual of zero spend, not against absolute conversion numbers
- 37signals does not share exact revenue or customer counts publicly — specific numbers add no instructional value and remove the private company advantage; share trajectory ("tens of millions in annual profit"), not the figure
- Don't measure blog traffic in the early stages — it kills enthusiasm before compounding begins; notice the regulars who come back, not the total count
- Measuring too early traps you: 37signals fell into this when switching blogging platforms, started tracking article traffic, and nearly lost the habit by obsessing over numbers that were still tiny

## Meaningful Work as Marketing Foundation

- "Make a dent in the universe" means your universe — the dent is your own assessment, not anyone else's; building something you're proud of produces the authentic enthusiasm that drives every other marketing mechanism
- Marketing only works when the founder actually believes in what they're building — inauthenticity leaks through every channel
- More than a third of workers self-report their work as meaningless (Graeber's research) — people doing bullshit work produce content that feels like bullshit to the audience
- Derivative products are a legitimate starting point; few original ideas exist, and improving on existing things is valid — the question is whether you're proud of the execution
- Small "dents" compound: Ta-Da List was discontinued in 2009, still had 1,000 weekly active users 12 years later — genuinely useful things outlive their official lifespans
- The business doesn't have to change the world; it has to matter to the customers it serves, and that mattering is what generates word-of-mouth that no ad budget can replicate

# Marketing & Growth

## Why Paid Advertising Fails Small Businesses

- Three serious attempts at paid ads over 25 years — none achieved break-even; cost-per-acquisition was "astronomical"
- Branded keyword buys on Google cannibalize organic clicks almost entirely — eBay ran millions in branded search, turned it off accidentally, nothing changed
- Software-as-service requires organizational buy-in, not impulse buying; ads work for sneakers and games, not collaborative tools
- Lifetime value at 37signals pricing (flat fee or low per-seat) is incompatible with $3,000–$20,000 customer acquisition costs typical of enterprise ad campaigns
- Brand advertising is hard to measure — running it for quarters and looking for overall lift shows no reliable signal because organic brand-building already does the heavy lifting
- Performance marketing channels (Meta, Google) take 90–97 cents on the dollar — the economic split feels wrong even when marginally profitable
- The only ad that generated measurable ROI was a provocative stance ad (calling out Google's practice of selling branded keywords to competitors), which went viral organically and landed DHH on CNBC — the idea beat the product pitch
- Competitors buying branded keywords on Google to intercept your traffic is a form of shakedown; 37signals chose to turn the issue into a public content moment rather than quietly pay to defend their own name
- ClickUp and Monday plaster ads everywhere — the assumption is they must be winning, but both are losing hundreds of millions per year; marketing spend equals spend, not success
- Following a competitor's marketing strategy means following someone who may be running off a cliff; you have incomplete information — all you see is the surface, not what's actually working behind it
- Conclusion: test paid channels rigorously, measure incrementality not just conversions, accept the result if economics don't work after multiple attempts

## Founder-Led Marketing: What It Actually Is

- Marketing at 37signals is not a strategy — it is a side effect of sharing things Jason and David genuinely care about; planning for marketing outcomes is the fastest way to produce fake-sounding output
- "Marketing is a transfer of enthusiasm" — if the founder isn't genuinely excited, no audience will be either
- Founders have personal credibility on the line in a way brands never do; it creates an authenticity pressure that forces quality
- DHH writing 500+ essays on HEY World, Jason posting product design decisions on social — these are driven by desire to share, not content calendars
- The term "content marketing" signals MBA-style instrumentalism; producing "content" to hit a quota is indistinguishable from spam to the audience
- Audience capture via algorithm is a real risk — the for-you feed rewards spicy takes and pushes toward a character, not the person
- Large follower counts with 17 likes per post = ghost audience bought or accumulated through tactics; an earned audience of 5,000 who actually buys is worth more than 500,000 disengaged followers
- DHH's HEY World mailing list generates 7 deep email replies per essay vs. thousands of shallow social interactions — the email exchanges are what he actually remembers; email replies are the Don Shanks of the modern era
- Jason's self-check: "If I didn't work here, would I ever spend another second on LinkedIn?" Honest answer: no — but he does it because it's part of the job
- Picking fights must be grounded in something you truly believe — if you go looking for a fight as a marketing tactic, it comes off contrived; the HEY vs. Apple conflict worked because it was completely unplanned and the reaction was completely genuine
- Small companies have a structural advantage in founder-led marketing: the founder linked to the product can speak for it in ways a revolving-door CEO never can — these principles are personal, not acquired through a focus group session

## Teaching as the Core Marketing Mechanism

- "Out-teach your competition" — sharing behind-the-scenes decisions, code samples, design choices, and business reasoning earns attention that ads can't buy
- The connection earned by genuinely teaching someone something is deeper and more durable than anything an ad impression creates
- Customers who've read 37signals writing for years arrive already aligned — "I signed up for Basecamp yesterday, I've been reading your stuff for five years" — no ad produces that relationship
- Teaching is free in the sense of not requiring ad spend, but it requires founders to remain intimately involved in building so their lessons are concrete and real
- 37signals wrote Getting Real (2006) and ran the "Building Basecamp" eight-hour seminar just one year after Basecamp launched — teaching was the launch strategy from day one
- The developer blog (dev.37signals.com) publishes actual code from commercial products, not abstract advice — this transparency is rare and magnetic to technical audiences
- Fear of sharing "secrets" is unfounded: execution and timing determine success, not code snippets; treat your company like a restaurant that also publishes a cookbook
- Don't share lessons as "seven tips" SEO bait — share only what genuinely interests the author; inauthentic educational content is worse than no content
- Sharing doesn't require production values — a 10-minute post written and shipped same-day captures freshness that a polished article scheduled two weeks out loses

## Blogging and Written Content

- Signal vs. Noise blog started in 1999 with no audience strategy — three people sharing internally decided to publish externally; the blog pre-dates the word "blog"
- No analytics in the early days was an advantage: without follower counts staring back, writing stayed authentic and enthusiasm drove output rather than metrics
- REWORK the book wrote itself — it is a curated by-product of years of blog posts, tightened and unified; it was never conceived as a book project
- Content schedules kill content: writing because it's Tuesday at 9am means you've already lost; the best posts emerge from inspiration, not cadence
- Don't measure blog ROI early — no audience exists at the start, so any metric looks terrible and will kill the habit before compounding begins
- Blogging builds credibility with compounding returns: 25 years of consistent sharing is why a single NYT feature or Lex Fridman episode caused a sustained measurable spike in signups — the media appearance amplifies an existing base, it doesn't create one
- Tech blog best practice: publish actual code from your commercial codebase, share real crises and how you navigated them, let any employee write without assignment or editorial approval, enforce no publishing cadence
- Every blog post lives forever — a post from 2016 still acquires readers in 2026; the cost is paid once, the value compounds indefinitely
- DHH used Twitter as a first-draft sketchpad: gut reactions become tweets, tweets get weathered in public debate, the best ones become blog posts, some blog posts become books or keynotes — one medium feeds the next
- Twitter/social posts are highest value when you're present to respond; auto-scheduling turns posts into monologues and destroys the community-building dynamic

## Audience Building

- An audience is people who come back to see what you have to say — distinct from people you've paid to reach once
- Build by sharing and giving with no expectation of return; occasional asks (product launches, new features) land only because the ratio of giving to asking is heavily weighted toward giving
- Audience building requires patience measured in years, but requires urgent impatience to share ideas the moment they arrive — inspiration is perishable
- Starting from zero audience is the right condition — you build exposure tolerance gradually; going from zero to one million overnight would be psychologically destructive
- Document, don't create: you're making decisions every day, so write up what you decided and why — this costs almost nothing extra and produces genuine content
- Respond directly: Jason and DHH are reachable by email, reply on social, engage in arguments — the "faceless brand" problem is solved by simply showing up as a person
- Small companies have a structural advantage: the founder who makes decisions can also explain them in real time, which large companies cannot replicate at speed or authenticity
- Avoid scheduling tools for social posts — when you auto-schedule, you're not there to respond, turning posts into monologues and destroying community-building value
- Polarizing opinions accelerate audience formation: people who love your takes and people who hate them are both more useful than indifferent followers — if no one disagrees, you don't have a point of view
- The courage to be disliked is required: if you have strong opinions and express them, you will have detractors; that's confirmation you actually stand for something, not a signal to soften
- If gatekeepers exclude you from the natural network of serendipity (conferences, VC social circles, geographic hubs), build your own — POCIT, Black & Brown Founders, and similar communities manufactured the serendipitous connections their founders couldn't find in existing networks

## Picking a Fight

- Pick fights with ideas, not product features — "our Gantt chart vs. their Gantt chart" is trivial; "project management is about communication, not statistics" is an idea worth fighting about
- Always punch up: fight competitors who are larger or better-known than you; never pick a fight with peers at the same scale (petty) and never with someone smaller (bully dynamic)
- Slack taking out a full-page ad welcoming Microsoft to chat looked absurd because Slack was the market leader in that space — dominance determines who gets to throw the first punch, not absolute company size
- The fight has to be grounded in genuine belief; manufacturing a pick-a-fight campaign in a marketing session produces something that falls worse than flat — the HEY vs. Apple conflict worked precisely because it was completely unplanned
- When the "overdog" punches back down it gives the story long legs — Apple's heavy-handed response to HEY is what created two weeks of intense media coverage; the rocket fuel came from the reaction, not the original provocation
- 37signals' core fight: "we've been profitable for 23+ years; if you have to make more money than you spend, buy from someone who does the same" — the contrast with loss-making SaaS competitors is a credible, values-grounded fight
- Being on the receiving end of attacks: grow a thick skin; if people are punching back it means you said something real; if you're insecure about your position, a rebuttal will knock you over; if you're well-grounded, it won't
- Ignoring competition (for product decisions) and picking a fight (for marketing) are not contradictory — ignore the competition so you don't follow them into product dead ends; pick a fight to illuminate your different values
- Polarizing creative works when the audience self-selects: the Quiznos spongmonkeys got 30,000 calls and letters in month one — half were complaints, but the product was a sandwich and the complainers weren't the target; complaints from the wrong audience are confirmation you reached the right one
- Distributing edgy creative on mass-market channels amplifies both the reach and the backlash — the spongmonkeys ran on general cable, not just SpikeTV/MTV, which horrified middle-aged viewers and created the very controversy that drove news coverage; the "wrong" audience reaction can be the fuel

## Selling By-Products

- Everything a company does creates by-products; spotting and packaging them is a low-cost growth channel that requires no additional core investment
- The Signal vs. Noise blog → Building Basecamp seminar → Getting Real PDF → REWORK book → ongoing workshops: each product fed the next without requiring a new strategy
- Getting Real was self-published as a $19 PDF with the buyer's name watermarked on each page — a simple piracy disincentive that made the business model tangible without DRM
- Workshops: run them when there's genuine enthusiasm, raise prices each time they sell out, stop when bored, restart when excited — no fixed schedule required
- Speaking and interviews are by-products: every talk and podcast conversation surfaces new angles that become blog posts or book chapters — Jason explicitly uses interviews to discover new ideas
- Spinoff products (Ta-Da List, Breeze) came from watching customers use Basecamp for things it wasn't designed for, then extracting that use case into its own product
- The test for a by-product's value: put a price on it and see if people trade money for it; free reception doesn't confirm value the way a purchase does
- By-product monetization works best when the core product has healthy margin — the extra revenue from books and workshops is bonus, not load-bearing
- Ruby on Rails is the ultimate by-product: extracted from Basecamp's codebase and open-sourced, it built a global developer community that fed Basecamp's hiring pipeline and brand for two decades at zero incremental marketing cost
- The flywheel: by-products generate audience → audience generates product signups → product usage generates new by-products → repeat; the job board 37signals ran was a by-product of their audience, not a primary business
- "Would I pay for this?" is the heuristic for whether a by-product has commercial potential; free reception from a community doesn't confirm value the way a purchase does
→ Episodes: sell-your-by-products, out-teach-your-competition, sell-your-by-products-season-2, ruby-on-rails

## Transparency and Behind the Scenes

- Opening up your process is a marketing mechanism: Basecamp's Getting Real YouTube series shows actual product decisions being made, not polished after-the-fact explanations
- Factory tours are the analog: Zingerman's publishes cookbooks revealing their recipes, yet customers still come; the transparency builds trust and authority rather than giving away competitive secrets
- Fear of revealing how things are made is unfounded — execution, team, and timing are what determine success; the recipe alone doesn't produce the restaurant
- Showing HTML mockups and working prototypes to potential customers beats slide decks — "show me the product" is what converts, not "here's our vision"
- Radical transparency as a marketing and community-building experiment: Dabble's "30 Days of Honesty" blog during a near-bankruptcy moment generated more goodwill and useful feedback than any polished marketing campaign
- The "30 Days of Honesty" project surfaced feedback that directly changed a pricing decision — customers recommended changes that the founders were too hesitant to propose themselves; the transparency created a safe channel for honest input
- Being willing to document struggles, near-misses, and wrong turns builds more authentic connection than only sharing wins — the imperfections are real and people respond to real
- "Document, don't create" applies to transparency: you're making decisions every day; writing up what you decided and why costs almost nothing extra and produces genuine, shareable content
- Invest in a realistic, resettable product demo: Basecamp built a full "seed data" demo account for HEY — 100+ realistic emails, a fictional persona (Julie Young), and a reset mechanism that wipes and reloads all content on demand; every demo starts fresh, no personal data is ever exposed, and support staff share one canonical demo environment instead of improvising from personal accounts
- Demo realism pays dividends beyond sales: the HEY seed account became the shared reference for the entire customer support team, enabling consistent and credible responses that screenshots of real email could not safely provide

## The Overnight Success Myth

- REWORK the book hit 1 million copies sold — 14 years after it was first published, and it was itself extracted from 7+ years of blog posts before the book existed; that is a 20+ year overnight success
- Squatty Potty's trajectory: years of health expos, pitching health bloggers, getting on Dr. Oz, being rejected by Shark Tank once, finally appearing on Shark Tank, and only then producing the viral video that "made them famous" — the viral moment was the tip of a very long iceberg
- Earned media follows the same pattern: individual appearances (Dr. Oz, Shark Tank) produce spikes, but the spike only sticks because the base of years of accumulated credibility is already there to absorb and sustain it
- There is no such thing as a sudden breakthrough — every overnight success is preceded by years of work that wasn't visible; the narrative of sudden discovery serves the media, not the entrepreneur
- Timing and luck play a real role: 37signals' early success with Basecamp (2004) benefited from being first in a new category at the right moment; that exact window doesn't reopen — but the principles still apply at any scale
- The implication for marketing: don't chase the viral moment; build the base that makes the viral moment matter when it arrives and lets you sustain the uplift rather than bounce back to zero
→ Episodes: the-myth-of-the-overnight-success, the-myth-of-the-overnight-sensation

## Scratch Your Own Itch

- Building a product you personally need is the most reliable path to authentic marketing: you can speak about the problem with genuine conviction because you lived it
- Basecamp was built to manage 37signals' own web design client projects; HEY was built because Jason and David hated how email worked — in both cases the founders were the lead customer, which guarantees the problem understanding is real
- When you scratch your own itch, you can assess quality directly — you know immediately whether the solution works, without needing surveys or user tests to tell you
- The marketing advantage: customers can detect when founders are describing a problem they actually have vs. describing what they think customers have; authenticity is perceptible
- Side projects scratched from personal itch have the same advantage at smaller scale — the board game designer who builds games she wants to play, the skincare blogger who formulated a product for her own skin, the backpack maker who needed a pack that didn't exist
- "Use the product you're selling" is table stakes for credibility: if you can't dogfood your own product, your marketing is a performance; if you do dogfood it, your marketing is just a report from the field
→ Episodes: scratch-your-own-itch-replay, scratch-your-own-itch, eat-your-own-dogfood, start-making-something

## Underdog Positioning

- Small is not a liability to apologize for — it is a genuine strategic advantage that should be foregrounded in marketing; "tools for rebels" and "tools for underdogs" are honest positioning statements, not spin
- The underdog ethos is a state of mind, not just a size category: you can be a small company that has lost the underdog mentality, or a mid-size company that retains it
- Underdogs move faster, stay closer to customers, and can make decisions in hours that large competitors need committees to approve in months — these are real competitive advantages worth naming
- The framing "we're like you" is more powerful for B2B software than any feature list: if your customer is a small business owner who has to make money to survive, buying from a company that has always had to make money to survive is a values alignment, not just a vendor choice
- Pick fights upward: being the underdog punching at a Goliath creates a story; being Goliath punching down destroys credibility (Slack vs. Microsoft dynamic — Slack was the incumbent in chat, so welcoming Microsoft looked absurd even though Microsoft was the larger corporation)
- The fastest-growing segment of new entrepreneurs is minority women, most of whom have zero access to VC money or Silicon Valley networks — they are building businesses under real constraints that look nothing like the startup archetype, and they are succeeding; the underdog story is the majority story, not the exception
- Scrappiness is a marketing asset when authentic: a team of four taking on Microsoft Project in 2004 creates a narrative no PR firm can manufacture; the narrative is only credible because it's true
→ Episodes: are-you-an-underdog-we-want-to-hear-from-you, pick-a-fight, the-soul-of-an-entrepreneur, start-a-business-not-a-startup

## Brand Naming and Identity

- The name "37signals" means nothing literally — it refers to radio signals from space that might indicate extraterrestrial life, chosen because it sounded interesting, not because it described the business
- The company renamed itself "Basecamp" after the product, then renamed itself back to "37signals" when they decided the company was bigger than one product — neither move meaningfully affected the business
- Names matter far less than you think: what builds the brand is the sustained output of writing, products, customer relationships, and public positions over years; no name carries that weight on its own
- The right name test: does it give you something to stand behind? Does it function as a vehicle for the attitude you want to project? A name like "37signals" has no inherent meaning, which means it can mean whatever the company makes it mean through its work
- Naming anxiety is a form of premature optimization: founders spend weeks agonizing over names while the business waits; pick something you can live with and build the meaning through what you do
- Company name changes are survivable: the fear that rebranding will destroy accumulated equity is usually overstated; customers follow products, not company names, when the products are good
→ Episodes: whats-in-a-name, aim-for-a-name, give-it-a-name

## Authenticity in Communication

- Customer support writing is a marketing surface: every support email is a brand impression; scripted, corporate-sounding responses ("apologies for the inconvenience") actively erode trust
- The goal in customer support writing is to sound like a specific person, not a company — Basecamp hires for genuine tone, not correct answers; the tone is evaluated in hiring samples before the answer is
- Avoid phrases that create distance or implied condescension: "sorry for the inconvenience" (nothing-phrase), "actually" (implies the customer was obviously wrong), and any language that makes the customer feel they missed something obvious
- Mirror the customer's emotional state: if someone is stressed and direct, excessive cheerfulness is annoying; the right tone is diagnostic, not formulaic
- AI-generated writing fails the authenticity test at the moment of receipt: when DHH and Jason reviewed 2,000+ job applications, AI-written cover letters were instantly identifiable and immediately disqualifying — not because AI is bad, but because the point is to read what *you* have to say
- AI as editorial assistant (thesaurus, second opinion on phrasing, sanity check) is valid; AI as author is not — if you don't have something original to say, the question is why you're writing in the first place, not how to generate content faster
- The Google ad that was pulled — a father asking Google to help his daughter write a heartfelt letter — was criticized not because it featured AI, but because it showed a parent outsourcing their own voice; inauthenticity is the issue, not the technology
- Inauthentic stock photography has the same problem at scale: images of "powerful business women with arms folded" or "smiling white man pumping fist" create an aspirational lie that audiences have learned to distrust; authentic visual representation (Colorstock's approach) breaks through precisely because it is genuinely representational
- Parasocial relationships are the mechanism behind effective direct-response advertising — when the person pitching looks and sounds like a friend who genuinely uses and loves the product, purchase intent rises; when there's visible mismatch (an acne product pitched by someone with perfect skin), the inauthenticity is immediately disqualifying
- Creative made for one medium doesn't transfer natively: content that works on the open internet (where the viewer chose to find it) feels invasive when beamed into passive broadcast media; platform-native creative is the modern equivalent — a viral Flash animation adapted for TV was seen as an assault by viewers who didn't seek it out; the same content shared virally online was beloved

## Free Plans and Conversion Strategy

- Free tier rationale: exposure drives organic growth for a product that sells itself once used — Basecamp converts through actual usage, not advertising
- Basecamp had a free one-project plan at launch, removed it in 2015 (short-term paid conversions improved), brought it back after recognizing that reduced exposure compounded negatively over years
- MailChimp's head of marketing credited their free plan as the single biggest inflection in their growth trajectory — that anecdote directly triggered the decision to reintroduce free at Basecamp
- Reintroducing free more than doubled weekly signups; early conversion rate held stable — the bet is measured on a 2–5 year horizon, not quarterly
- Free plan design: one-project limit but unlimited collaborators — the viral mechanism is guests receiving invitations to someone else's free Basecamp, then becoming users themselves
- HEY cannot easily offer free tiers: each email account costs real server money and the namespace creates permanent address allocation problems that Basecamp's project model doesn't have
- Pricing starting point: pull a number from your gut ("ass-pricing"), test whether you would personally pay it, then test on customers — elaborate pricing research is usually wasted effort for early-stage software
- Start prices higher than you think is right; you can always lower but raising is politically painful — the $2/month increase on Backpack triggered customer rage disproportionate to the dollar amount
- Never raise prices on existing customers; change prices only for new customers, let churn naturally rotate the base to the new pricing structure over time
- A/B testing cadence: look at weekly aggregates, not daily; tests need weeks to reach significance, and early peeking produces false winners
- "Ask reality for an answer" — run the test rather than relying on results from years ago; markets, products, and customers change enough to invalidate historical A/B data
- Presenting the most expensive plan first on pricing pages tested better for plan mix — but this finding doesn't transfer across industries or even across time for the same product
→ Episodes: bringing-back-free, mailbag-1-1

## Metrics and What to Measure

- Vanity metrics (follower counts, impressions, raw clicks) don't map to business outcomes for a low-price, high-consideration product like Basecamp
- Aggregate trajectory over months and years matters more than any single spike — individual viral moments are exciting but the baseline moving average is what sustains the business
- Spikes from media appearances (DHH on Lex Fridman, Jason's NYT feature with Ezra Klein) produced measurable and sustained baseline lifts — but you can't plan for spikes; you build the base that makes spikes matter
- Incremental analysis is the only honest metric for paid advertising — compare performance against the counterfactual of zero spend, not against absolute conversion numbers
- 37signals does not share exact revenue or customer counts publicly — specific numbers add no instructional value and remove the private company advantage; share trajectory ("tens of millions in annual profit"), not the figure
- Don't measure blog traffic in the early stages — it kills enthusiasm before compounding begins; notice the regulars who come back, not the total count
- Measuring too early traps you: 37signals fell into this when switching blogging platforms, started tracking article traffic, and nearly lost the habit by obsessing over numbers that were still tiny
- Measuring customer support response times caused reps to optimize for speed over quality, generating stress without improving outcomes; they pulled back to a range ("under 10 minutes is excellent") rather than a competitive metric
- No revenue targets, no growth goals at the company level: "things are wonderful right now" is itself a target — external stakeholders (public markets, VCs) are what inject the quarterly number obsession; stay private to stay free of it

## Testing Creative Before You Commit

- The infomercial industry invented rigorous creative testing decades before A/B testing was a software concept: buy a small media test ($25k), measure media efficiency ratio (gross revenue / media cost), and use a 1.7:1 ratio as the minimum threshold — below it, rework or kill the concept; above 2:1, scale aggressively
- Test one variable at a time: run the same commercial with only the product name changed (Mobile Cane vs. Get Up & Go Cane) to isolate name resonance, then lock the name and test price points — the Get Up & Go Cane at $39.95 outperformed the same product at $19.95, doubling profit with identical costs
- The "does America love you" test: before investing in optimization, run a minimal buy to answer a binary question — does the market respond at all? Failure at this stage means fundamental concept problems that price or copy tweaks won't fix (the first Thighmaster test failed because of wardrobe, not the product)
- Show the idea to your actual target audience before showing it to the client: the Martin Agency filmed real college-age men watching the "We Love the Moon" spongmonkey video and compiled their unfiltered reactions (laughing, saying "this is f***ing awesome") — the client presentation opened with this reaction reel, not the campaign itself; the audience sold the work before the agency had to
- Creating anticipation before revealing the work is a presentation technique: "What are those guys looking at?" asked of the client before playing the commercial caused them to lean forward and want to see the answer — the ask activates curiosity and lowers defensive judgment
- The hook window on social/digital video is three seconds: everything else is optimization of what comes after a viewer has already decided to stay — design the first three seconds as if the rest doesn't exist, then optimize the remainder once you know which hook version wins
- TV / video is used for testing, not primarily for direct sales: for every infomercial buyer, 10–15 people buy the same product at retail; the commercial's job is to create brand recognition and demand that converts at point of purchase, not just at the "call now" moment
- Strong creative that is genuinely weird or polarizing earns press coverage that paid media cannot buy: the Quiznos spongmonkeys were covered by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Ad Age, and Adweek — none of that coverage was purchased; the strangeness was the story
- Creative power is with the creator, not the client: the spongmonkeys worked because Quiznos licensed Joel Veitch's pre-existing, self-motivated work ("something you feel driven to make") rather than commissioning him to produce something sensible to spec; the best branded creative often starts as someone's personal obsession
- A brand that abandons distinctive creative for "beauty shots" and category-standard advertising gets category-standard results: Quiznos went from 4,700 to 400 US locations in 10 years after replacing the spongmonkeys with conventional food photography

## Meaningful Work as Marketing Foundation

- "Make a dent in the universe" means your universe — the dent is your own assessment, not anyone else's; building something you're proud of produces the authentic enthusiasm that drives every other marketing mechanism
- Marketing only works when the founder actually believes in what they're building — inauthenticity leaks through every channel
- More than a third of workers self-report their work as meaningless (Graeber's research) — people doing bullshit work produce content that feels like bullshit to the audience
- Derivative products are a legitimate starting point; few original ideas exist, and improving on existing things is valid — the question is whether you're proud of the execution
- Small "dents" compound: Ta-Da List was discontinued in 2009, still had 1,000 weekly active users 12 years later — genuinely useful things outlive their official lifespans
- The business doesn't have to change the world; it has to matter to the customers it serves, and that mattering is what generates word-of-mouth that no ad budget can replicate
- Motivation is the most underrated asset in marketing: a four-person team that is ferociously motivated to solve a problem they actually have will outmarket a 200-person team running on quarterly targets — motivation produces tunnel vision and rocket fuel simultaneously
- Pick the problem you're most fired up about, not the most commercially optimized one; motivation gives you the X factor that compensates for everything you lack in resources, team size, and brand recognition

## Seven Shipping Principles

How 37signals develops and releases software. Source: [37signals.com/seven-shipping-principles](https://37signals.com/seven-shipping-principles)

1. **We only ship good work** — No excuses based on promises or time invested. Code and design you'd be proud to revisit months later.
2. **We ship when we're confident** — Confidence matches criticality. Data mutation and major features need thorough testing. Presentation changes and non-critical paths need less.
3. **We ship when the work is finished** — Don't let completed work linger behind feature flags. Clear it and move forward.
4. **We own the issues after we ship** — Teams monitor error trackers and fix substantial problems. Routine enhancement requests get filed for later.
5. **We don't ship if it isn't right** — Last-minute pauses are justified. Both "Is it right?" and "Is it good?" must be yes.
6. **We ship our collective best effort** — Anyone can raise quality concerns. Senior team members' insights deserve default consideration.
7. **We ship to our appetite** — Projects operate within defined timeframes (2, 4, or 6 weeks). Constraints force necessary trade-offs.

## The 37signals Guide to Making Decisions

38 questions as thinking frames for better decisions. Source: [37signals.com/how-we-make-decisions](https://37signals.com/how-we-make-decisions)

- **Does a decision actually need to be made here?** — Not everything requires a formal decision.
- **Who has the most context to decide?** — The right person, not the highest-ranking person.
- **Is this reversible?** — Reversible decisions need less deliberation.
- **Can this big decision be broken into smaller ones?** — Smaller decisions are easier to get right.
- **What would future-you think of this choice?** — Consider long-term perspective.
- **What does your gut say?** — Instinct has value alongside data.
- **Why are you hesitating?** — Hesitation carries information.
- **What precedent does this set?** — Decisions ripple forward.
- **Does this affect customers differently than the company?** — Align incentives.
- **Would waiting change the outcome?** — If not, decide now.
- **Is the effort worth the return?** — Don't over-invest in low-stakes decisions.

These are thinking tools, not a checklist. Which questions matter depends on context.

## Why We Choose Profit

Why 37signals stays profitable by design. Source: [37signals.com/why-we-choose-profit](https://37signals.com/why-we-choose-profit)

- **Profit buys time** — The ultimate flexibility. Freedom to change direction without permission.
- **Annual distributions** — Take risk off the table progressively as an LLC, don't compound it.
- **Self-funded autonomy** — No investors means no strings. Own your decisions completely.
- **Simplicity** — No debt, LLC structure, minimal lawyers and accountants.
- **Natural focus** — Profitability constrains scope. Can't dilute across too many initiatives.
- **Customer stability** — Unprofitable companies risk layoffs, service cuts, instability. Profitable ones offer reliability.
- **No valuation theater** — No stock options, public markets, or investor relations. Energy goes to the actual business.
- **Recession-proof** — Profitability insulated 37signals through 2008-2009 and 2022 while VC-backed competitors froze.

Profitability = independence + stability + customer-first.

- **The Manual** (Epictetus) — "Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things."

## The 37signals Guide to Internal Communication

30 rules for how 37signals communicates. Source: [37signals.com/how-we-communicate](https://37signals.com/how-we-communicate)

### Philosophy

- **You cannot not communicate** — Silence is a message. Not discussing the elephant is communicating.
- **Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time** — Default to async.
- **Writing solidifies, chat dissolves** — Substantial decisions require complete written thoughts.
- **Speaking helps who's in the room, writing helps everyone** — Including future employees.
- **Meetings are the last resort, not the first option.**
- **Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison.**
- **If words can be perceived in different ways, they'll be understood in the way which does the most harm.**
- **Sleep on it** — End of day convinces you it's good. Next morning tells you the truth.

### Daily Practices

- **98% of internal communication happens inside Basecamp** — No email, Slack, Teams, or formal meetings.
- **Daily check-in at 4:30 PM** — "What did you work on today?" Loose accountability and reflection.
- **Weekly planning on Monday mornings** — "What will you be working on this week?" Company-wide visibility.
- **Six-week heartbeats** — Reflect on recent accomplishments.
- **Six-week kickoffs** — Project upcoming work.
- **Contextual discussions** — Comments on tasks stay with tasks. Discussions on documents stay with documents.

## Group Chat: The Best Way to Totally Stress Out Your Team

Why persistent group chat does more harm than good. Source: [37signals.com/group-chat-problems](https://37signals.com/group-chat-problems)

### 4 Things Chat Is Good For

1. **Quick ideation** — Tossing ideas back and forth between a few people.
2. **Critical alerts** — Server outages and genuine emergencies.
3. **Social bonding** — Informal conversation, humor, culture.
4. **Remote inclusion** — Connection and belonging for isolated workers.

### 17 Problems With Chat

1. **Mental exhaustion** — An all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda.
2. **False urgency** — Real-time pressure makes everything feel immediately critical.
3. **FOMO anxiety** — Fear of missing important moments forces constant vigilance.
4. **Fragmented thinking** — Line-by-line prevents complete thought presentation.
5. **False consensus** — Decisions made without people's consent because they weren't there.
6. **Reactive responses** — Shallow, unconsidered replies under time pressure.
7. **Conversation breakdown** — Multiple participants derail focused discussions.
8. **Endless repetition** — New participants rehash previous points.
9. **Attention interruption** — Constant notifications fragment focus.
10. **Return anxiety** — Dread upon viewing accumulated unread messages.
11. **Unread multiplication** — One email becomes dozens of chat lines.
12. **Mystery notifications** — Badge numbers lack context about importance.
13. **Manic context-shifting** — Sidebar chat windows destroy deep work.
14. **Poor searchability** — Finding specific conversations is nearly impossible.
15. **Decontextualized discussion** — Conversations detach from source materials.
16. **Presence pressure** — Green dots create expectations of constant availability.
17. **Timezone dysfunction** — Real-time fails across distributed teams.

### The Fix

Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time. Tool design shapes culture more than user discipline.

# 37signals Manifesto

37 principles that drive how 37signals builds products, runs their company, and thinks about work.

## Product Development

**03. Small teams** — You can do big things with small teams, but it's hard to do small things with big teams. Small is often plenty.

**05. Err on the side of do** — Act and move on. Most decisions are temporary anyway.

**06. Shape Up every six** — Six-week cycles: long enough to build something meaningful, short enough to maintain perspective. ~8 chances per year to reassess priorities.

**21. Know no** — Saying no is a commitment to one thing. Saying yes rejects everything else.

**24. Fixed** — Keep timelines and budgets fixed. When challenges arise, scale back scope—don't add time, money, or people.

**33. Planning is guessing** — Plans are guesses. The longer-term the plan, the worse the guess. Turn 3-year plans into 3-week plans.

**34. Sleep on it** — End of day convinces you it's good. Next morning tells you the truth. Even if you're sure, sleep on it.

**36. Context > consistency** — Design around the current context rather than forcing conformity with prior decisions.

## Work Culture & Time

**08. 8/8/8** — Eight hours work, eight hours life, eight hours sleep. Sleep deprivation isn't dedication—it's stupidity.

**09. NOTASAP** — Urgency is overrated. ASAP is poison. Real-time is the wrong time most of the time.

**11. Don't emulate the office** — Remote work means fewer meetings, async communication, and trust—not recreating the office at home.

**12. Hours aren't equal** — 60 uninterrupted minutes beats four 15-minute blocks. Days chunked into tiny blocks are a terrible way to work.

**14. Meetings aren't free** — Five people in a room for an hour is a five-hour meeting. Meetings are the last resort, not the first option.

**15. Bury the hustle** — Hustle porn leaves people exhausted and anxious. Do great work during reasonable hours, then live your life.

**35. Companies aren't families** — "Family" rhetoric is a veiled demand for total sacrifice. Great companies are allies to employees' actual families.

## Business Philosophy

**01. An obligation to independence** — No investors, no board, no exit plans. Independence is a moral obligation—use it to skip safe and go for original.

**04. Profit motive** — Make more than you spend. Old school economics 101.

**07. We don't sell you** — Customers pay for products. No selling data, no targeted advertising.

**10. The Fortune 5,000,000** — Small and mid-sized companies are underserved and deserve respect. That's who we build for.

**16. The trap of marginal thinking** — "If you need a machine and don't buy it, you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it." —Henry Ford

**20. Small tech** — Big tech takes, snoops, targets, gouges, and tramples. Champion independence and ethical business practices instead.

**22. Stayups** — Celebrate companies that stick around for the long term. Longevity generates trust.

## Communication & Decisions

**02. Work isn't war** — Drop the conquering, capturing, targeting, and destroying. We come in peace.

**13. On repeat** — If you're talking about something new, you'll have to repeat yourself for years before you're heard.

**18. Two tokens of customer service** — Take complaints seriously first. If you minimize, the customer must escalate.

**25. Disagree and commit** — The right decision matters more than consensus. Debate fully, then commit fully.

**30. Miscommunication problems** — The problem isn't communication—it's miscommunication. Smaller teams have fewer opportunities for misinterpretation.

**31. Easy?** — "Easy" is a word people use to describe other people's jobs. Don't assume unfamiliar work is simple.

## Mindset & Identity

**17. Politicking** — Respect everyone's right to political expression, but keep political debates off internal work channels.

**19. Pay people, not addresses** — Same role, same pay, regardless of location.

**23. Thoughting vs. thinking** — Long-term planning is what you thought. Short-term planning is what you think.

**26. Kick in the face, kick in the ass** — Crises aren't purely negative. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste. Build antifragility.

**27. Broadly speaking** — Customers in 160+ countries, team across 5 continents. Diversity of perspective guards against parochial thinking.

**28. Shots on goals** — Set goals based on who you'll become, not who you are now.

**29. JOMO not FOMO** — Joy of missing out. Life's better when you're missing stuff that doesn't matter.

**32. Ruby on Rails** — Invented here. The free, open-source framework that runs Shopify, GitHub, Airbnb, Basecamp, HEY, and thousands more.

**37. What's in a name?** — 37 unexplained radio signals from outer space. A catalog of ideas—signals—that drive us.

# Dave Hone: T-Rex, Dinosaurs, Extinction, Evolution, and Jurassic Park | Lex Fridman Podcast #480

## T. rex Size and Biomechanics

- T. rex measured approximately 12 meters long, 4.5 to 5 meters tall at the head, and weighed roughly 7 metric tons — Tom Holtz's description of "an orca on land" captures the scale accurately.
- A T. rex skull (not a particularly large specimen — a cast of the Smithsonian specimen) is large enough for a grown adult human to fit through the mouth opening.
- T. rex teeth were not just long but exceptionally thick in cross-section — nearly a third of the width compared to Carcharodontosaurus teeth of similar length — making them far stronger and more resistant to breakage.
- T. rex had tennis-ball-sized eyes, and absolute eyeball size (not proportional size) is what drives visual acuity; Hone suspects T. rex was primarily nocturnal given those large eyes and its open-environment hunting context.
- T. rex was almost certainly not running in the biomechanical sense — both feet off the ground simultaneously — but power-walking, with one foot always on the ground due to the loading requirements of a seven-ton body; stride length of four to five meters made speed irrelevant.
- The most recent detailed estimates put T. rex's top speed at around 25 mph (40 kph), with the actual figure likely somewhat less.
- The tail muscles in theropods, analogous to the massive caudal musculature in crocodilians, were the primary locomotion engine — a T. rex caudofemoralis muscle was approximately 2.5 to 3 meters long and anchored to the femur, contracting to pull the leg back and propel the animal forward.
- T. rex's middle metatarsal bone (the arctometatarsalian foot) narrows into a flattened diamond shape in cross-section, which locks the flanking metatarsals around it, preventing energy loss in each stride and functioning like the energy-return air soles of athletic shoes.
- T. rex arms had only two functional fingers, the smallest ligamentous pits of any tyrannosaur (indicating extremely weak grip ligaments), and proportionally un-curved claws — the arms were likely vestigial in function by the time T. rex reached its final form.
- T. rex was the largest carnivore in its ecosystem by a ludicrous margin — the next biggest predators were animals roughly the size of a Velociraptor skull, a size disparity Hone compares to African lions coexisting with nothing bigger than a weasel.

## Hunting Strategy and Diet

- Carnivores across all taxa, including large dinosaurs, preferentially hunt juveniles rather than adults — bite mark evidence and stomach contents from large carnivorous dinosaurs consistently show prey of roughly 5 to 20 percent of the predator's own mass.
- Juvenile prey animals are easier to catch for four compounding reasons: they are naive about predators, they forage in suboptimal (riskier) areas because adults displace them, they are less efficient at foraging and thus spend more time exposed, and they lack the horns, armor, or size of adults.
- T. rex almost certainly both actively hunted and scavenged — healed bite marks with a T. rex tooth broken off inside a bone prove active predation, while bite marks sitting on top of erosion damage (showing the carcass was exposed and windblown before being eaten) prove scavenging.
- T. rex's hunting strategy was likely persistence-based rather than sprint-based, analogous to wolves or hyenas rather than cheetahs — its energy-efficient foot and nocturnal vision would have allowed it to close distance on slower, large herbivores in the dark.
- T. rex used two distinct feeding behaviors: large lateral teeth for puncturing and dismembering (producing deep circular punctures in bone), and small, flat-backed incisiform teeth at the front of the jaw for scraping muscle off bone at specific attachment sites like the deltopectoral crest.
- The claim that T. rex could only detect movement and would miss a stationary human is fictional with no traceable scientific source — Hone could not find the paper Crichton cited in The Lost World, and the animal's giant eyes make the claim anatomically implausible.
- T. rex was "the only big carnivore" in its Late Cretaceous North American ecosystem (alongside only small carnivores the size of a Velociraptor skull), which means any large bite mark on a large bone from that time and place was definitively made by T. rex.

## Fossil Discovery and Excavation

- Paleontologists currently name approximately 40 to 50 new dinosaur species per year and have done so consistently for at least 10 to 12 years; the total count of named valid species is roughly 1,500 to 1,600 and shows no sign of slowing.
- Most dinosaur fossils are found by surface survey rather than high-tech scanning — walking slowly over outcrops of the right geological age, looking for bone protruding a few millimeters from a hillside; in one case Hone describes, less than one centimeter of claw tip visible led to the discovery of a 90%-complete skeleton (eventually named Linheraptor).
- Fossil bone is porous and infiltrated by minerals from its host rock, making density nearly identical to surrounding sediment — this defeats MRI, seismic, and radioactivity-based remote sensing, which all rely on density contrast; bones in uranium-bearing formations are mildly radioactive but too weakly to detect through rock.
- The standard preservation agent for fragile fossils is Paraloid, a reversible glue that wicks into porous bone and consolidates it; it can be fully dissolved back out with acetone without chemically altering the specimen.
- Stan the T. rex was found in 1987 by amateur paleontologist Stan Sekanson in the Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, excavated by the Black Hills Institute Larson brothers, required over 30,000 lab hours to prepare, and ended up about 70 percent complete by bulk and 63 percent complete by bone count.
- Stan sold at Christie's in 2020 for $31.8 million — far more than expected, as previous complete T. rex specimens had sold for a few million dollars — and was purchased by Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism.
- On protected US government land, paleontologists are often prohibited from using wheeled vehicles; large fossils that cannot be carried out must be stripped of surrounding rock on-site to reduce weight for helicopter extraction.
- Bone orientation mapping at a dig site (the direction long bones point relative to current flow) reveals whether an animal died in place or was transported by water, and can predict which small bones are likely missing and where they might have drifted downstream.

## Tyrannosaur Evolution

- Tyrannosaurs first appear in the Middle Jurassic roughly 165 million years ago as small bipedal carnivores about 2 to 3 meters long — chest-high to a human, with long arms, and indistinguishable from other small carnivores of the period.
- The fused nasals (the two top-of-snout bones that fuse into a single solid structure in tyrannosaurs) appear even in the earliest, smallest members of the group and are present 100 million years before T. rex — likely originally an adaptation for resisting the pulling forces of the small incisiform teeth at the snout tip.
- Yutyrannus, an Early Cretaceous tyrannosaur from China, reached 6 to 7 meters and over half a ton, and has three definitive feathered specimens — feathers are confirmed in tyrannosaurs at least 100 million years before the extinction.
- The tyrannosaur lineage split in the Late Cretaceous into the long-snouted alioramine branch (fast-biting but lightly built, likely hunting small prey) and the tyrannosaurine branch (broad, heavily built skulls with extreme bite force), of which T. rex is the most extreme member.
- Cope's Rule — the evolutionary tendency for lineages to grow larger over time — applies to tyrannosaurs, but the rule works because bigger individuals win territorial and mating contests day-to-day, while extinction events reset the clock by disproportionately killing large-bodied species.
- T. rex's skull contains dramatically more bone than same-length competitors like Giganotosaurus — the antorbital fenestra and other skull openings that are enormous in Giganotosaurus are nearly closed in T. rex, reinforcing the skull to withstand the extreme bite forces.

## What Jurassic Park Got Wrong

- The Velociraptor of Jurassic Park is based on Deinonychus (a larger Early Cretaceous dromaeosaurid), not the actual Velociraptor, which stood about a meter tall at the head and was roughly two meters long — thigh-high and much smaller than the human-height animals in the films.
- The "T. rex can only detect movement" trope has no scientific basis — Hone searched extensively and believes Crichton invented it for dramatic purposes, with a fictional citation added in The Lost World's sequel to lend it credibility.
- Pack hunting in any dinosaur species has essentially no solid fossil evidence; the famous Deinonychus-Tenontosaurus bone bed is better explained by a predator trap (multiple carnivores independently attracted to a dying herbivore and becoming trapped) than by coordinated pack behavior.
- Even confirmed multiple-tyrannosaur tracksites — which have as few as five footprints total — show only that multiple animals moved in the same direction, not that they were hunting cooperatively; spotted hyenas, which frequently appear in group-hunting documentaries, mostly hunt alone.
- Gallimimus in Jurassic World was given teeth by the production team — an animal that has a beak and no teeth — an error Hone discovered in the tie-in children's book; the change is nearly invisible on screen and made the animal less accurate for no dramatic benefit.
- The Jurassic Park Pteranodons in JP3 are described as mostly excellent for their era, while the Jurassic World redesigns are significantly less accurate despite being made 13 years later; a Hollywood creature designer confirmed to Hone that making accurate versions requires no more effort than inaccurate ones.
- After the original Jurassic Park's success, Spielberg established the Jurassic Foundation, a small research grant fund for dinosaur paleontology that has continued for over 30 years — subsequent films in the franchise show less evidence of this kind of scientific engagement.

## Spinosaurus

- Spinosaurus potentially reached 15 meters in length based on a single outsized set of jaws in a Milan collection — longer than any T. rex specimen — but was far lighter and more narrowly built, making T. rex still more massive.
- Multiple independent lines of evidence converge on spinosaurs as semi-aquatic fish specialists: crocodile-like conical teeth (the only non-round tooth cross-section in any carnivorous dinosaur), crocodile-like skull mechanics, isotopic signatures in teeth matching aquatic animals rather than terrestrial dinosaurs, consistent association with water-bearing rock formations, and direct evidence of fish scales inside the body cavity of Baryonyx.
- Hone and colleague Tom Holtz published papers arguing that Spinosaurus was not a good active swimmer, a position that has since been partly endorsed by some of the original authors who claimed swimming ability; Hone describes it as most likely a large wader — a giant stork or heron analog.
- Spinosaurus is distinguished from relatives like Baryonyx and Suchomimus by its very short legs, elongated dorsal neural spines forming a distinctive sail, and a laterally expanded paddle-like tail — features its relatives mostly lack, making it an extreme outlier even within its own group.
- In a direct confrontation, T. rex would likely defeat Spinosaurus: Spinosaurus's long thin jaws provide relatively low bite force and its neck is structurally weak in rotation (good at up-down movement, poor at twisting), while T. rex has the strongest neck and bite of any land animal in its ecosystem.

## Dinosaur Intelligence, Cannibalism, and Behavior

- T. rex's brain is known from endocasts (internal molds of the braincase) and is small relative to body mass — consistent with a large crocodilian, not a primate; a 2023 paper claiming primate-level neuron density was rapidly rebutted, with revised estimates of 250 million to 1.7 billion neurons rather than the claimed 3 billion.
- CT scanning of the inner ear structure can determine the frequency range to which a dinosaur's cochlea was tuned — a technique that is technically impressive but currently tells researchers relatively little about behavior.
- T. rex cannibalism is confirmed: a tyrannosaur foot bone from Hell Creek bears multiple feeding scrape marks (not fighting punctures) consistent with T. rex teeth, with no healing indicating the animal was dead; since T. rex was the only large carnivore in its ecosystem, the author of those bite marks is unambiguous.
- Half to two-thirds of adult T. rex skulls show healed facial scarring, suggesting frequent intraspecific combat — likely dominance and mating contests; the feeding trace evidence on the foot bone is distinct from these combat injuries in both mark type and lack of healing.
- Carnivores generally avoid cannibalism because conspecifics carry the highest parasite load of any available prey — a lion eating another lion ingests every parasite the other lion accumulated from a lifetime of eating prey; cannibalism in T. rex likely occurred opportunistically when a carcass was available rather than as a hunting strategy.
- Over 90 percent of dinosaur species are known from a single specimen — often incomplete — making population-level behavioral inferences nearly impossible; Protoceratops andrewsi from Mongolia is the rare exception, with over 100 good specimens spanning from embryos to large adults from a single location and a narrow time window of roughly 100,000 years.

## Extinction

- The Chicxulub impactor struck just off the Yucatan Peninsula approximately 66.5 million years ago; Hone describes it as roughly the size of Mount Everest traveling at around ten times the speed of sound, with the impact rock being exceptionally sulfur-rich, producing one of the worst possible outcomes for atmospheric contamination.
- All five recognized mass extinctions in Earth's history are ultimately forms of climate change happening too fast for adaptation — volcanic eruptions, hyper-oxygenation, ice ages, or asteroid-driven nuclear winter; it is ecosystem collapse, not direct death, that eliminates most species.
- Big terrestrial animals suffered worst in the K-Pg extinction for compounding reasons: higher caloric requirements that cannot be met when plant productivity crashes, smaller population sizes that reduce genetic diversity and the chance of a resistant individual, slower reproduction rates that limit evolution's ability to respond, and inability to migrate the way aquatic animals can.
- Water is a thermal buffer — it heats and cools slowly — which is why aquatic and semi-aquatic lineages (fish, crocodilians, turtles, frogs) disproportionately survived the K-Pg event while terrestrial megafauna did not.
- Hone considers it nearly certain that some non-avian dinosaurs survived in isolated refugia — equivalent to Hawaii, New Zealand, or the Galapagos — for thousands to possibly millions of years after the main extinction event, but the odds of finding fossiliferous rocks of that precise age and location are vanishingly small.
- Recent analyses show non-avian dinosaurs were not in decline before the asteroid impact — they were ecologically healthy and diverse right up to the boundary, making the extinction entirely contingent on the impact rather than a trajectory already in progress.
- Human evolution would almost certainly have been impossible if the K-Pg extinction had not occurred — dinosaurs dominated every terrestrial ecological niche larger than a raccoon for approximately 140 million years during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, leaving no opening for large mammals.

## Birds as Living Dinosaurs and the Evolution of Feathers

- Birds are dinosaurs in precisely the same sense that humans are apes — trace bird ancestry back far enough and the nearest relatives are small dromaeosaurid theropods very close to Velociraptor; there is no clade boundary between non-avian dinosaurs and birds.
- There are approximately 10,500 to 11,000 living bird species, making birds the most speciose class of land vertebrates and meaning that dinosaurs never actually went extinct — roughly 10,000 species of dinosaur are alive today.
- Feathers predate bird origins by at least 100 million years — definitive feathered tyrannosaurs (e.g., Yutyrannus) from the Early Cretaceous and probable feathered tyrannosaurs from the Middle Jurassic confirm that feathers evolved long before flight.
- Eight or nine major theropod groups were fully feathered, including tyrannosaurs, dromaeosaurs, troodontids, ornithomimosaurs, and oviraptorosaurs; feathers likely evolved for insulation first (most dinosaurs maintained elevated body temperatures like modern birds and mammals) and for socio-sexual display second.
- Feathers enable sexual selection displays that scales cannot — they can be shed seasonally, can change between juvenile and adult plumage, can be erected and fanned, and can encode structural colors — giving feathered lineages far more evolutionary flexibility for signaling than bone-based display structures like horns or frills.
- Birds almost certainly survived the K-Pg extinction primarily because of small body size — multiple bird lineages went extinct at the boundary, and only a handful of small-bodied lineages crossed it; from those survivors all 10,000+ modern species descend.

# Paul Rosolie: Uncontacted Tribes in the Amazon Jungle | Lex Fridman Podcast #489

## The Mashco-Piro and Uncontacted Tribes

- Across the Amazon basin there are still perhaps thousands of clans of uncontacted peoples living in nomadic isolation, who actively choose to remain that way.
- The Mashco-Piro are known to outsiders by that name, but they refer to themselves as "Nomole," meaning "brothers" in a dialect shared with neighboring Yine-speaking communities.
- "Mashco" essentially means "wild Piros" — a label given by outsiders — while the tribe's own identity is the Nomoles.
- In August 2024, two loggers were killed by Mashco-Piro warriors after cutting down a shihuahuaco (ironwood) tree that Paul estimated was over 1,200 years old and stood about 160 feet tall.
- The ironwood being felled is described as having begun its life as a sapling before the Spanish reached Peru, predating Leonardo da Vinci's mature work.
- The Mashco-Piro do not make clay pots, do not know that water freezes or boils, and have no metal tools — a Peruvian anthropologist noted, "People think of them as Stone Age tribes, but they don't even have stones."
- The tribe raids neighboring communities and logging camps specifically for machetes, which function as an Excalibur-level tool to them.
- Their arrows are approximately seven feet long, tipped with fire-cured bamboo sharpened to a knife edge, fletched with twisted plant-fiber so the arrow spins in flight, and fired from bows of equal length.
- Mashco-Piro archers can hit a spider monkey out of the treetops at 40 meters with these bows.
- The tribe can move through the forest in total silence; a person being stalked will only realize it when an arrow passes through them.
- Their history of violence is rooted in colonial trauma: missionaries from the 1600s–1700s and rubber barons of the late 1800s–1900s subjected the tribes to extraction and cruelty, teaching them that the only survival response to outsiders is immediate violence.
- Ranger Ignacio was shot in the head by a Mashco-Piro arrow in 2019, survived, and still bears the scar.
- On a separate occasion, Ignacio hid from the tribe for two hours in the peak of a small structure in extreme midday heat, soaking through a mattress, knowing that discovery meant death.

## The October 2024 Encounter

- In October 2024, Jungle Keepers received a satellite phone call from a remote indigenous community saying the tribe was emerging, and Paul's team compressed a two-day boat journey into a single night, riding upriver from 6 PM through a lightning storm until 8 AM.
- Paul navigated the night journey by spotting caiman eye-shine on the river banks to find the channel, while convulsively shivering from cold despite 80-degree air temperatures.
- Anthropologist Romel was the only person present capable of communicating with the tribe, because a subset of the Yine dialect overlaps with the Mashco-Piro language; he stood at the river's edge repeatedly calling "Nomole" — "brothers."
- The October clan was one that Romel had never contacted before; he stated this was first contact for this particular group, with members ranging from approximately 12 to 40 years old.
- The clan numbered around 50 visible warriors, and the Jungle Keepers group of 26 was completely surrounded: warriors approached along the beach while women silently raided the community's farm from behind, pulling up yucca and banana plants.
- Paul estimates they were outnumbered at least five to one and could have been massacred easily.
- A canoe piled with plantains was sent to the tribe as a peace offering; rather than dividing food communally, each warrior grabbed individual bananas, fighting others for them.
- As tension eased, Ignacio danced a little and they danced back — a brief moment of cross-cultural joking.
- The anthropologist gave the tribe his shirt and pants and ended up in his underwear; Ignacio then threw his Jungle Keepers polo to the anthropologist, who passed it to the tribe — an uncontacted warrior walked away wearing a Jungle Keepers logo shirt.
- Romel told Paul the tribe had asked specifically about him, describing him as looking like a warrior; Paul walked to the beach, raised his palms, and the tribe raised their hands and sang back to him.
- The day after this peaceful encounter, a tribesman named George was driving a boat upriver when approximately 200 tribe members ran out, surrounded the vessel, and fired arrows — one arrow entered just above his scapula and exited near his belly button; he was medevacked by helicopter and survived.
- Two key questions from the tribe during the encounter: "How do we tell the good outsiders from the bad ones?" and "Why are you cutting down the trees?" — cutting large trees appears to carry near-religious offense for them, as if killing their gods.
- Both of the dominant speakers wore grapefruit-sized necklace containers apparently made from Brazil nuts and animal teeth, which they kept dry and handled carefully — anthropologists had no explanation for them.

## Jungle Keepers Conservation Mission

- Jungle Keepers has protected 130,000 acres of the Los Piedras river basin in the western Peruvian Amazon and is raising funds to protect an additional 200,000 acres — most of that remaining territory is within uncontacted tribe lands.
- Paul's strategy converts former loggers and gold miners into paid rangers, giving local people better livelihoods while building the protection capacity needed to patrol the territory.
- The organization has several thousand monthly donors contributing between $5 and $1,000 each, which funds the ranger program and operations.
- After a single social media post about a new road threatening 100,000 acres of uncontacted tribe territory, Jungle Keepers raised $150,000 in 48 hours and bought the concession, stopping that road.
- The total funding needed to protect the full river corridor is estimated at $20 million; Paul describes this as achievable either through a large surge in small donors or a single major philanthropic commitment.
- The loggers and land owners who own the Amazon are not conservationists by default — owning 10,000 acres of jungle provides no income to a city-dwelling third-generation landowner, so they contract loggers, miners, or narcos to extract value.
- Once Jungle Keepers holds title to the land, Peruvian police can legally arrest anyone present on that land, which gives law enforcement a clear enforcement mechanism.
- A 16-foot solar-powered glider drone capable of flying for two weeks at a time is being explored as a surveillance tool to detect canopy disturbances from new roads and airstrips.

## Narco-Traffickers and the Drug War on the River

- Narco-traffickers moved into the river basin by first paying poor locals a few thousand dollars to clear jungle land with chainsaws, then returning a year later to convert those settlers into safe-house operators and coca growers.
- Narcos build hidden airstrips by clearing the interior of a landing strip while leaving the canopy trees at the edges so their tops meet overhead — invisible from satellite imagery and overflying aircraft; bush pilots duck under the canopy to land, load, and depart.
- When Paul flew a drone over a new clearing in March, the occupants — whom he initially assumed were loggers — chased his boat at speed; he crash-landed the drone in the jungle and was escorted to safety by armed police.
- Hours after Paul shook hands with the police officer who escorted them to safety, narcos conducted a drive-by shooting, killing that officer with a shotgun blast to the chest.
- Police intercepted a WhatsApp message from an arrested narco that read: if you see JJ or the gringo, anyone in our network, please kill them — you will be rewarded.
- Both Paul and JJ now have active bounties on their lives; Paul describes waking at 4 AM in a sweat from recurring dreams of being shot, and having a full PTSD response every time his phone rings unexpectedly.
- A Jungle Keepers driver named Percy was stopped on the road by narcos who blocked it with a felled tree; gunmen put pistols through his windows asking for "JJ and the mierda gringo volador" — JJ had changed his travel plans at the last minute and was not in the vehicle.
- The narco operation brings human trafficking along with drug production: men in remote jungle camps procure women by raiding nearby indigenous communities.
- There are reports of narcos making contact with the uncontacted tribes and using automatic weapons against them — the tribes have no defense against machine guns.
- Environmental defenders are assassinated in the Amazon every year; Paul cites Chico Mendes and Dorothy Stang as historical examples of the same pattern his team now faces.

## Wildlife and Animal Encounters

- The largest anaconda Paul has personally caught measured just under 20 feet (19 feet something); he has had direct encounters with four or five anacondas in the 20–26-foot range.
- Paul has caught over 90 anacondas in the wild; large females are consistently non-aggressive toward humans because at their apex size, they treat most encounters as minor annoyances rather than threats.
- The anaconda caught on the famous Instagram post was mid-shed, with scales over her eyes turned blue — Paul had never previously caught a blue-eyed anaconda.
- When the team tried to lift the 19-foot anaconda to measure her, she flexed her body and sent 10 people flying to one side, then the other.
- Paul has handled an 11-foot bushmaster, one of the most venomous snakes in the Americas, by grabbing it by the tail; it reared up but did not strike after he set it down.
- A jaguar walked past Paul on a jungle trail at close range, made direct eye contact, and kept walking without altering its pace — Paul attributes this partly to not using scented products in the field.
- In India, Paul accidentally walked into a male elephant that had been harassed by humans; the elephant charged for real (not a mock charge), smashing through trees, and Paul only escaped by throwing himself off a 12-foot cliff into a stream below.
- Macaws can only reproduce in ironwood trees that are at least 500 years old and large enough for hollow branches; only 17–20% of the macaw population reproduces in any given year because suitable nest sites are so scarce.
- The "Mist River" — an invisible atmospheric river carrying more moisture above the Amazon canopy than flows in the Amazon itself — became visible to Paul at 100+ feet up a shihuahuaco at dawn, when morning sunlight lifted mist off the canopy in golden currents flowing north to south over the jungle.
- Spider monkey orphans care more about physical contact and warmth than about food; when given the choice between sustenance and the closeness of a body, they choose connection.

## Jane Goodall and Conservation as a Calling

- Jane Goodall passed away on October 1st, 2025, and Paul traces his entire career directly to her intervention.
- Paul failed out of high school, began taking unmatriculated college classes, and spent nearly a decade going to the Amazon with JJ for the love of it before anything professionally surfaced.
- At an NYU talk, Paul handed Goodall a manila envelope with two unpublished chapters — one about raising a giant anteater named Lulu, one about catching anacondas — and asked her to endorse a book that did not yet exist; 48 hours later she agreed.
- Every publisher in New York had already rejected the manuscript; HarperCollins changed its position after Goodall's endorsement and published the book as Mother of God.
- Goodall was on the road 300 days a year and shook hands with hundreds of fans at each event, yet still read an unknown young writer's work and responded with a substantive endorsement.
- Paul quotes Goodall's maxim — "The greatest danger to our future is apathy" — as the philosophical foundation for continuing conservation work through injury, fear, and repeated loss.
- Goodall's example has shaped Paul's own approach to people who approach him: he stops what he is doing and pays full attention, because the next person asking "how do I get your job?" might be the one who goes on to protect a river.

## Advice for Young People and the Writer's Life

- Paul's core advice: throw yourself headfirst into adventure and just do it, without waiting for credentials or a defined career path — "someone less qualified than you is living your dream life right now."
- He describes the conservation career as starting like washing dishes in a restaurant: you are at least in the building, and over years of doing the work, responsibility finds you.
- The emotional cost of deep caring is real: Paul describes watching beloved forest sections burn as a "cacophony of life silenced into horrible violent silence," and carrying that grief on a daily basis.
- Paul journals every day as a discipline of accountability and memory — keeping notebooks with written observations, leaf etchings, and stories so that mundane moments are not lost.
- His writing process is brain to paper to laptop, always with a handwritten draft in between; he writes when inspired rather than on a fixed daily quota, then edits "dozens and dozens" of times.
- His sister, described as having lived more in literature than most people live in real life, serves as his primary editor, returning marked-up chapters.
- His stylistic influences include Cormac McCarthy for dark, visceral landscape prose; Ernest Hemingway for minimal declarative sentences where "the unsaid does the driving"; Anthony Bourdain for direct, conversational narrative; and F. Scott Fitzgerald for crystalline descriptions of human emotional moments.
- Paul can reliably detect when a message has been written by an LLM and worries about what is lost in AI-generated prose — the thing Fitzgerald captured, like a voice cracking "at the highest register," requires lived observation that models cannot replicate.
- Paul is currently writing his third book, tentatively titled Endgame, documenting the narco-trafficker escalation and a harrowing expedition further up the river into a region he compares to "Amazonian No Country for Old Men."

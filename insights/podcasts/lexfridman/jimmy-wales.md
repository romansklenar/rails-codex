# Jimmy Wales: Wikipedia | Lex Fridman Podcast #385

## Origin of Wikipedia

- Wales was inspired by the open-source software movement — specifically the way programmers collaborated under free licenses — and recognized the same model could apply to cultural works like an encyclopedia.
- Before Wikipedia, Wales ran Nupedia, a seven-stage peer-reviewed encyclopedia project that spent nearly two years producing almost nothing because the process was too intimidating and academic.
- The first article Nupedia published after its rigorous review process had to be pulled within days because the broader web community spotted plagiarism that the academic reviewers had missed.
- Wales personally felt too intimidated to write a short biography of economist Robert Merton for Nupedia because the draft would be sent to prestigious finance professors for critique — "like the bad part of grad school."
- Wikipedia launched in January 2001 as a side project to Nupedia, with two of Wales's employees — Jeremy Rosenfeld and Larry Sanger — independently suggesting the Wiki concept in December 2000.
- In its first two weeks, Wikipedia produced more content than Nupedia had in nearly two years, because anyone could jump in immediately without a formal process.
- In the very early days, Wales himself got to be the first person to type "Robert Aumann won Nobel Prize in economics" after Aumann won; within two days, others had expanded and improved the stub.
- The initial software was UseModWiki, a single Perl script running on a server with all data stored in flat text files, using Unix `grep` as the search engine — a setup clearly never designed to scale.

## Design and Technical Evolution

- The original UseModWiki had no real login system — users could set a username but there were no passwords, meaning anyone could impersonate anyone else; Wales quickly wrote a basic login and password system.
- Links in early Wikipedia were made using CamelCase (smashing capitalized words together); Wales switched to double square brackets, which created cleaner red-link and blue-link navigation.
- German keyboard layouts had no square bracket key at the time, yet German Wikipedia became a massive success anyway — users learned alt codes or copy-pasted brackets from elsewhere.
- Wikidata now fulfills an idea discussed in Nupedia's early email threads: a single data source (e.g., city population figures) that updates automatically across all language editions of Wikipedia.
- The question of what belongs in an encyclopedia arose early: when someone uploaded the full text of Hamlet, the community decided that belonged in Wikisource, not Wikipedia — leading to the creation of that separate project.
- Wikipedia's English edition contained 6.6 million articles and over 4.3 billion words as of May 27, 2023, with a total of 58 million pages including non-article content.
- Wales remembers being present in Germany with Wikipedians the night German Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles; at Wikimania 2006 in Harvard, a visitor from Poland pointed out that even then only a small fraction of notable Polish biographies existed in English Wikipedia.

## Notability, Biographies, and Editorial Standards

- Wales uses the term "verifiability" rather than "notability" to describe the threshold for an article — the real question is whether enough is known about a subject to write an encyclopedia entry.
- Wikipedia uses the designation BLP1E — "biography of a living person notable for only one event" — as a warning category, particularly for crime victims who were private individuals before a single public incident.
- Wales immediately removed a paragraph about a Midwestern city council member's son's DUI arrest from that politician's biography because it was clear "undue weight" — the son's arrest had no connection to the father's public conduct.
- Wales argues that a dedicated "Controversies" section in any biography is poor editorial practice because it invites editors to hunt for more controversies just to fill the section.
- Wikipedia deprecated the MailOnline (digital arm of the Daily Mail) as a source, not as an outright ban, but as guidance that editors should seek higher-quality sources when the tabloid is the only citation available.
- Wales illustrates the "citogenesis" problem — vandalism appears in Wikipedia, a journalist cites it as a source, a Wikipedian then finds the journalist's article and adds it as a reference, creating a circular citation — using a story about Biography Magazine incorrectly reporting that he enjoys playing chess with friends.
- Categories in Wikipedia can be as contentious as article content: Wales successfully argued against being listed in the "American atheist" category on the grounds that atheism is a private belief for him, not a cause he campaigns for publicly.

## Neutrality and Political Bias

- Wales does not believe Wikipedia has broad left-leaning political bias; when pressed for examples on Twitter, critics typically struggle to produce specific evidence.
- Wikipedia's most persistent subtle biases are in non-political areas: Japanese anime articles tend to be overwhelmingly positive because only enthusiasts write them, with no opposing voices to create balance.
- Wales cites Wikipedia's handling of mask efficacy during COVID-19 as an example of good neutrality — the article ultimately reflects the mixed evidence accurately, rather than the overcorrecting messaging from public health authorities.
- The "definition of recession" controversy involved only one editor moving the traditional "two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth" definition from the lead paragraph further down; Wales describes it as a routine editorial restructuring that Twitter amplified into a conspiracy about Biden administration pressure.
- The Twitter Files controversy on Wikipedia was even more mundane: a single editor nominated the article for deletion citing a question about whether to merge it into the Hunter Biden laptop page; the nomination was closed within hours as a "snowball" — no chance of passing — yet Elon Musk publicly treated it as suppression.
- Wales identifies demographic blind spots as a more reliable source of bias than political ones: Wikipedia volunteers are estimated to be over 80% male, college-educated, and skewing toward tech, which leads to weaker coverage of topics like early childhood development and female novelists.
- A study found that male novelists who had won major literary prizes had longer, higher-quality Wikipedia entries than equally awarded female novelists — not due to conscious sexism but because volunteers write about what they read and know.

## Government Pressure and Censorship

- Wales states that the Wikimedia Foundation has never complied with government pressure to alter content anywhere in the world and never will; when governments threaten to block Wikipedia, the Foundation's consistent response is "knock yourself out."
- This "hardcore" stance has been strategically effective: governments know they cannot casually threaten a brief block to extract compliance, so most choose not to escalate.
- Wales met with China's Minister of Propaganda in person, not to accommodate demands, but to explain how Wikipedia works — and to make the argument that blocking Wikipedia prevents Chinese citizens from sharing their own culture and history with the world.
- The Wikimedia Foundation received zero requests from the FBI or other US government agencies to alter any content in Wikipedia; had such requests arrived, the Foundation would have noted it cannot change content that is written by a volunteer community.
- Wales distinguishes between governments with physical staff on the ground (where compliance to avoid arrests creates a genuine moral dilemma) and standard legal threats, for which refusal is the only acceptable response.
- Wales argues that public health authorities like WHO damaged long-term trust in science by issuing statements they knew were partially false (e.g., early "masks don't help" messaging) in order to prevent PPE shortages — a strategy that backfired severely.

## Funding Model

- Wikipedia is operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, a US registered charity, funded almost entirely by donations with no advertising on the site.
- The majority of donors give small amounts — typically around $25 — with millions of individual donors each year; the Foundation deliberately avoids reliance on large corporate donors to prevent influence from creeping in.
- Wales made the no-advertising decision largely for aesthetic reasons in the early days, not primarily as a strategic business calculation — he simply did not want ads on Wikipedia.
- The advertising model would create misaligned incentives: if Wikipedia ran ads, readers might wonder whether Nissan paid to influence its Wikipedia entry; the donation model eliminates that conflict entirely.
- Without advertising, Wikipedia has no incentive to optimize for time-on-site, clickbait headlines, listicles, or engagement algorithms — the sole editorial incentive is what is most interesting to the volunteer community.
- The first fundraiser was held on Christmas Day 2003, after two of the site's three servers crashed; Wales hoped to raise $20,000 in a month and raised nearly $30,000 in two to three weeks.
- The most effective donation messaging was found to be a fairness pitch — "you use it all the time, you should chip in" — outperforming appeals based on helping underserved communities in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- The Wikimedia Foundation's endowment fund recently passed $100 million and is governed by a separate board from the Foundation itself, designed so no future leadership can access those reserves without independent oversight.

## ChatGPT, AI, and Wikipedia

- Wales experimented with ChatGPT-4 to find examples of white athletes being compared to fast cars, to explore whether such analogies have racial dimensions; the model produced three highly plausible but entirely fabricated quotes from named athletes that returned zero results on Google.
- Wales believes ChatGPT is programmed to be helpful and agreeable rather than truthful, which causes it to invent plausible-sounding answers rather than simply saying "I don't know."
- Wales sees GPT-4 as a potentially useful tool for Wikipedia editors: it is already capable of flagging potentially biased language and suggesting more neutral rewrites, though it tends to be somewhat anodyne.
- A practical AI tool Wales wants to see built: feed a Wikipedia article and all its sources into a language model and ask it to identify any claims in the article not accurately supported by those sources — even imperfect results would help editors prioritize review of obscure entries.
- Wikipedia's community policy on AI-generated content is roughly: human editors are responsible for what they submit; using ChatGPT to check grammar in a non-native language is fine, but submitting fabricated AI content is not.
- Wales's head of machine learning built a weekend prototype where ChatGPT was asked which Wikipedia articles are relevant to a question, those articles were then retrieved, and ChatGPT answered using only that grounded text — preventing hallucination while leveraging Wikipedia's quality.
- Wales is not worried that ChatGPT will cannibalize Wikipedia's traffic, because proper citation grounding will place Wikipedia at the top of most AI-generated source lists — just as Wikipedia ranks highly in Google search.
- Wales predicts that AI-powered machine translation will dramatically accelerate Wikipedia's growth in smaller languages (e.g., Zulu) where quality translation was previously impossible, making an "invisible trend" of encyclopedia growth in developing-world languages suddenly viable.

## Community and Culture

- Wales describes the English Wikipedia arbitration committee — the final court of appeal on editorial disputes — as "some of the most powerful people in English language media," yet they are volunteer geeks chosen because they are kind, thoughtful, and well-liked in the community.
- One of Wikipedia's founding rules is "ignore all rules," meaning new contributors should not be driven away by formatting pedantry — someone adding a useful link should be welcomed and gently taught formatting, not scolded or banned.
- An editor who went on to become a prominent Wikipedian started her editing career at age 13 as a vandal; a community member patiently asked why she was doing it, she reflected and became a constructive contributor.
- Wales says he personally would not edit the Donald Trump article because he gets too emotional — knowing one's own editorial blind spots and stepping back from those topics is a mark of a good Wikipedian.
- Wales ran WT Social (WikiTribune Social), a social network designed around a membership rather than advertising model, optimizing for content users find meaningfully life-enhancing rather than maximizing engagement and page views.
- Wales draws an analogy between advertiser-funded broadcast television (producing broadly inoffensive content for maximum reach) and subscription HBO (producing high-quality content for specific audiences) to argue that funding model determines content quality.
- Wales gave an annual "Wikimedia contributor of the year" award to Annie Rauwerda, creator of the popular Instagram account Depths of Wikipedia, which surfaces obscure and amusing Wikipedia articles.
- Wales's favorite Wikipedia article is "Inherently Funny Words" — it was once nominated for deletion, survived after an editor demonstrated it is a legitimate concept in comedy theory, and formerly featured a caption reading "According to some, cow is an inherently funny word."

## Future of Wikipedia

- In ten years, Wales expects Wikipedia to look broadly similar but with AI-assisted search allowing users to ask natural language questions and receive answers grounded in Wikipedia's body of text, with links to source articles.
- The Wikimedia Foundation builds reserves every year and maintains a $100 million endowment held by a separate board, designed to ensure Wikipedia can survive financial shocks over a 100-year horizon.
- Wales sees large language models as a step-change technological moment comparable to the first web browser, the first iPhone, and Google Search replacing AltaVista.
- One near-term AI risk Wales highlights: LLMs enable highly personalized, grammatically correct spam emails that read your LinkedIn profile and pass filters — a qualitatively new problem compared to misspelled mass spam.
- Wales believes the proliferation of AI-generated content will strengthen trust in established brands (Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Wikipedia) relative to unknown websites, because readers will increasingly need provenance signals to evaluate content.
- For advice to young people, Wales emphasizes two complementary principles: persist through hard times, and be willing to pivot completely when something genuinely is not working — the challenge is correctly diagnosing which situation you are in.
- Wales considers the decision not to sell Wikipedia to advertisers or take venture capital easy at the time; he watched MySpace collapse after Rupert Murdoch's ad-heavy approach and sees it as confirmation that business model shapes culture and outcomes in ways entrepreneurs underestimate.

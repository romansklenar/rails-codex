# Greg Lukianoff: Cancel Culture, Deplatforming, Censorship & Free Speech | Lex Fridman Podcast #397

A rigorous, data-heavy examination of cancel culture's scope and mechanics by the person who has tracked campus speech cases professionally since 2001.

## Defining Cancel Culture and FIRE

- Lukianoff defines cancel culture as the uptick of campaigns starting around 2014 to get people fired, expelled, or deplatformed for speech that would normally be protected by the First Amendment.
- FIRE was founded in 1999 by Harvey Silverglate and Alan Charles Kors, a leading Enlightenment scholar and Voltaire expert.
- FIRE distinguishes itself from pure First Amendment organizations by defending free speech culture broadly, not only government censorship.
- The biggest sin in censorship law is viewpoint discrimination: banning a specific opinion within an otherwise open forum, which is more serious than limiting a topic entirely.
- Lukianoff frames free speech as fundamentally an epistemological commitment — the only way to know what people really think is to let them say it.
- Censorship causes preference falsification (a term from economist Timur Kuran): society ends up with an inaccurate picture of actual public opinion.
- Suppressing speech does not change opinions; it pushes people to talk only to those who already agree, accelerating group polarization.

## The Historical Arc: From Berkeley to 2014

- The Free Speech Movement began at Berkeley in 1964; Herbert Marcuse's "Repressive Tolerance" followed in 1965, explicitly arguing the left should suppress right-wing speech.
- John Huss was burned at the stake in 1415 for ideas Luther successfully spread a century later only because the printing press existed by then.
- Lukianoff noticed a slow-motion train wreck forming in law school in 1997 and at the ACLU in 1999 as anti-free-speech ideas gained legitimacy on campuses.
- The inflection point was 2013–2014: before that, students were FIRE's best constituency for free speech; after that, students began advocating for deplatforming and new speech codes.
- Cancel culture from the right includes legislative action: Florida's Stop WOKE Act, which attempted to ban topics related to race and gender in higher education, was declared "dystopian" by the presiding judge and struck down; FIRE won the lawsuit.
- Roughly one-third of successful attempts to get professors punished come from the right, often from off-campus pressure campaigns and legislative sources.

## College Free Speech Rankings

- FIRE's annual ranking at rankings.thefire.org surveys students directly on comfort with disagreeing with peers and professors, acceptance of violence or shouting down speakers, and policy audits.
- The top school in the most recent ranking was Michigan Technological University; second was Auburn University; UVA was the highest-ranked prestigious school.
- University of Chicago dropped from perennial top-three to rank 13 after refusing to recognize a Turning Point USA chapter while acknowledging a Campus Republicans chapter — a classic viewpoint discrimination case.
- Harvard received the only "abysmal" score, a negative 10.69 rounded to zero, finishing dead last among 248 schools.
- The bottom five — Harvard, Georgetown, Penn, Fordham, University of South Carolina — had 81% success rates for deplatforming attempts; Georgetown and Penn achieved 100% success rates.
- Harvard's defenders argued methodology flaws and that penalized scholars weren't prominent enough — which Lukianoff called snobbery; even accepting all their objections, Harvard would still rank last.

## Deplatforming Mechanics and Administrative Complicity

- When Kyle Duncan, a Fifth Circuit judge, was invited to speak at Stanford Law School, roughly a fifth of the student body showed up to shout him down.
- Ten minutes into the shout-down, a DEI administrator delivered a prepared seven-minute speech arguing "the juice isn't worth the squeeze" for free speech — evidence of prior coordination.
- At University of Washington, administrators bought tickets for angry students and ran training sessions before a comedy show, directing students to shout "I'm offended"; subsequent death threats led police to refuse protection for the performer.
- A university president who publicly commits to not punishing a professor or expelling a student can end a cancellation campaign quickly; most presidents fail to do this.
- Administrators who facilitate deplatforming almost never face consequences; the Stanford DEI administrator who gave the prepared speech is one of the only examples of someone not being invited back.

## The Scale of Professor Cancellations vs. the Red Scare

- Between 2014 and mid-2023, FIRE tracked over 1,000 attempts to get professors fired or punished; about two-thirds resulted in some punishment and roughly one-fifth in termination — nearly 190 professors fired.
- The most comprehensive Red Scare study (mid-1950s) found approximately 60–100 professors fired for communist affiliations over 11 years; Lukianoff argues the current 9.5-year cancel-culture era has already surpassed that total.
- During the Red Scare, 9% of professors reported self-censoring their research; FIRE's current faculty survey finds 90% self-censoring across research, classroom, and online activity combined.
- After 9/11, approximately five professors lost their jobs for insensitive speech — then considered a scandal; current rates dwarf that.
- 17% of professors surveyed said they had been threatened with investigation or actually investigated for their teaching, research, or speech; one-third were told by administrators not to pursue controversial research.

## DEI Statements as Political Litmus Tests

- The founding scholars of Critical Race Theory — Richard Delgado, Mari Matsuda, and others — first project was creating a new category of unprotected speech called hate speech.
- California Community Colleges mandated that even chemistry professors incorporate intersectionality and anti-racism frameworks into their syllabi — which Lukianoff calls worse than banning speech because it compels specific ideological content.
- FIRE researcher Nate Honeycutt ran an experiment with nearly 3,000 professors evaluating four types of DEI statements: standard intersectionality identity politics, viewpoint diversity, religious diversity, and socioeconomic diversity.
- Administrators reviewing DEI statements eliminated approximately half of the viewpoint-diversity statements before the files ever reached hiring committees.
- The socioeconomic-diversity version was eliminated by around 40% of reviewers despite Lukianoff viewing it as the most important form of diversity lacking in elite higher education.
- Only the standard intersectional-identity-politics statement passed readily, proving DEI statements function as ideological litmus tests regardless of their stated purpose.
- Richard Feynman is Lukianoff's test case: a non-right-wing scientist whose empiricism and iconoclasm would disqualify him from most DEI-screened hiring pools.

## Rhetorical Fortresses: How Arguments Are Avoided

- Lukianoff and co-author Rikki Schlott (a 23-year-old libertarian journalist) structure "The Canceling of the American Mind" around three claims: cancel culture is real and historic in scale; it is part of a lazy rhetorical system for winning arguments without winning arguments; and there are concrete fixes.
- The left's "perfect rhetorical fortress" begins by labeling someone conservative — which functions as a complete dismissal without engaging their argument.
- Lukianoff admits he personally avoided reading Thomas Sowell and Camille Paglia in law school because someone had convinced him they were right-wingers.
- The fortress then proceeds through demographic dismissals: white, male, straight — each layer allows ignoring the argument; even the most intersectionally marginalized person can be dismissed as a heretic if their opinion is wrong.
- Every prominent Black conservative Lukianoff and Schlott personally interviewed confirmed being told they were "not really Black" for holding a dissenting opinion, including Coleman Hughes and John McWhorter.
- The right's "efficient rhetorical fortress" works in four steps: label the person a liberal, dismiss experts with the wrong view, dismiss journalists with the wrong view, and among MAGA Republicans, dismiss anyone not pro-Trump.
- Whataboutism is the most universally deployed tactic: deflecting from a specific criticism by raising a different grievance from the other side, never addressing the original claim.
- "Hypocrisy projection" — assuming your opponent is a hypocrite without researching whether they are — is a favorite tactic against FIRE; multiple accusers have turned out to be quoted in the very articles they didn't read before tweeting.
- Cancel culture as a rhetorical tactic is designed to run out the clock: by the time identity-based dismissals are exhausted, the original argument is never reached.

## Hate Speech Law and the Pure Informational Theory

- Hate speech is not an unprotected category of speech under U.S. First Amendment law; the flag-burning precedent established that offensive speech cannot be banned because offensiveness is too subjective.
- European hate-speech codes work (imperfectly) because those societies assume a modal citizen; the U.S. has always been a hodgepodge with no single modal American identity.
- Lukianoff's "Pure Informational Theory" (also called "the Lab and Looking Glass Theory") holds that suppressing speech actively degrades society's knowledge of what people believe.
- Research data in the book shows that driving users off Twitter in 2017 and again in 2020 to Gab led to measurable radicalization among those users — censorship reliably makes extremism worse.
- Allowing the Nazis to speak at Skokie in the late 1970s deflated the movement: they looked like "racist fools," the rally fell apart, the Blues Brothers mocked them, and the chapter dissolved.
- Daryl Davis deradicalized multiple Klan members simply by befriending them — demonstrating that exposure and curiosity are more effective at changing minds than suppression.
- Jennifer Sey, VP at Levi's, was canceled in 2020 for arguing that school closures would harm disadvantaged children most; that position is now conventional wisdom, yet the cancellation stigma outlasts the vindication.

## Social Media, the Printing Press Analogy, and Platform Design

- Lukianoff draws a direct parallel between Henry VIII's 1538 licensing requirement for printing presses and current efforts to regulate social media: both are attempts to put the genie back in the bottle during an unavoidably anarchical transitional period.
- Short-term printing-press effects included surging witch trials, religious wars, and misinformation; long-term effects included the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment — the same trajectory Lukianoff projects for the internet.
- Social media adds billions of eyes to every problem but currently uses them mainly for "cat videos and canceling" — the equivalent of the early, chaotic printing-press decades.
- X/Twitter functions as the collective unconscious of the species: raw, real-time, unprecedented, capable of being joyful or awful depending on which neighborhood you inhabit.
- Lukianoff proposes an opt-in "truth-focused stream" within X governed by explicit rules banning perfect and efficient rhetorical fortresses, with community-flagging of specific tactics like whataboutism.
- Generation Z reports the highest hatred of cancel culture of any demographic surveyed — which Lukianoff reads as a cultural immune response beginning to activate.
- Banning top-down social media (e.g., TikTok bans, age-verification requirements) will not work; only cultural adaptation and creating high-integrity institutions can fix the epistemic crisis.

## Depression, CBT, and the Personal Cost of the Culture War

- In 2007, Lukianoff called 911 on himself after going to a hardware store to prepare for a suicide attempt; he was admitted to the Belmont Psychiatric Facility in Philadelphia.
- The suicidal depression was partly driven by constant culture-war combat as FIRE president: being denounced by both the left (for defending conservatives) and the right (for defending people who made 9/11 jokes).
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy — writing down catastrophizing thoughts and labeling the distortions (mind reading, fortune-telling, overgeneralization) multiple times daily for months — gradually made the destructive inner voice "not convincing anymore."
- Nine months after the suicide attempt, Lukianoff was happier than he had been in a decade; the CBT insight directly led to "The Coddling of the American Mind" when he noticed administrators were marketing those same cognitive distortions to students.
- A professor friend who was canceled in June 2020 shot himself the following week; Lukianoff had spoken to him a week before without detecting the severity of his despair.
- Writing "The Canceling of the American Mind" triggered a second depressive episode; confessing this to his leadership team and attending the Dialogue conference (curated cross-partisan off-the-record conversations organized by Auren Hoffman) provided the relief needed to finish the book.
- Taylor Swift's public quote on cancel culture describes a clear "kill yourself" undercurrent in sustained pile-ons — Lukianoff uses it alongside quotes from Obama, the Pope, and James Carville to rebut claims that cancel culture is not real.

## Hope and Systemic Fixes

- Lukianoff argues the most powerful structural fix is creating prestigious, rigorous, low-cost credentialing alternatives to elite universities — a "super BA" exam that only 1 in 100 people can pass, breaking Harvard and Yale's monopoly on the ruling class.
- Elite higher education enrolls more students from the top 1% of incomes than from the bottom 50–60%; Evan Mandery's book "Poison Ivy" documents this in detail.
- Sal Khan and Khan Academy are cited as an example of an alternative credentialing and education stream worth scaling.
- Viewpoint diversity in academic departments is the structural antidote to sacred ideas: research by Cass Sunstein on group polarization shows politically diverse groups reliably produce more moderate, better-tested conclusions.
- Harvard's economics department is roughly 4:1 left to right; some humanities departments contain literally zero conservatives — which Lukianoff calls an intellectually unhealthy environment.
- High-integrity institutions that are predictably consistent across political lines — like FIRE's commitment to defend any speech regardless of viewpoint — are the building blocks of a more trustworthy epistemic ecosystem.
- People are "sick of not being able to be authentic," which Lukianoff believes is unsustainable and will drive cultural correction over time.

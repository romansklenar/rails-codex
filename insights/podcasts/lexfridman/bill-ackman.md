# Bill Ackman: Investing, Financial Battles, Harvard, DEI, X & Free Speech | Lex Fridman Podcast #413

## Value Investing Fundamentals

- Benjamin Graham's *The Intelligent Investor* — the first investment book Ackman ever read — taught him the core distinction: "price is what you pay, value is what you get," and that the stock market is like a neighbor who makes you a daily offer on your house — a stupid offer you ignore, a great offer you take.
- Graham's key insight is that the stock market is a voting machine in the short term (speculative, driven by sentiment) but a weighing machine in the long term (accurate, reflecting intrinsic value) — investing success depends on identifying what a business is actually worth.
- Ackman defines the value of any asset as the present value of all future cash flows — the same framework applies to a US government bond (predictable coupons) and a stock (uncertain earnings you must forecast).
- Graham's margin-of-safety principle: buy at a price so deep below your estimate of value that if you are 30% wrong, you still come out ahead — Ackman calls this the foundation of not losing money.
- Pershing Square holds roughly eight to ten positions at any time, putting around 20% of assets into each — the concentrated approach demands that every investment be researched to a near-encyclopedic level.
- Ackman's research process begins with SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, proxy statements), then goes backward five years of conference call transcripts to track whether management under-promises and over-delivers or does the opposite, then adds industry experts via expert networks, competitor analysis, and books about the sector.
- He looks for businesses that can "close the stock market for a decade" and still be more valuable and profitable ten years later — Universal Music Group (a third of global recorded music) and Chipotle are his canonical examples.
- On diversification: individual investors owning 10–12 high-quality businesses they personally understand capture most of the benefit of diversification; going from 12 to 50 positions adds very little incremental safety while diluting focus and returns.
- His general advice to everyday investors: never invest money you cannot afford to lose, never borrow against securities, and own businesses you personally understand as a consumer — early Tesla buyers who loved the product were better analysts than most professionals.

## Activist Investing and Corporate Governance

- Activist investing differs from passive index investing (which now exceeds 50% of all stock market capital) by combining deep ownership stakes with public or private pressure to improve management decisions, capital allocation, or strategy.
- Ackman's first activist investment at Pershing Square was Wendy's — he identified that Wendy's owned 100% of Tim Hortons, which was worth more than the entire $5 billion Wendy's enterprise value, effectively making Wendy's free — after the CEO refused to return calls, Ackman mailed a fairness opinion from Blackstone, and within six weeks the company acted.
- His model of activism has three escalation levels: outside-the-boardroom letters and public pressure, board representation after shareholder vote, and in extreme cases full board replacement — Pershing Square has executed all three.
- Pre-SEC rule changes, running a proxy contest required spending heavily on mailing fees and flying city-to-city to pitch large institutional shareholders — comparable to running a small political campaign against an incumbent who spends unlimited corporate money defending itself.
- Boards of 20 years ago were described by Ackman as "cushy" rubber-stamp positions — directors collected hundreds of thousands of dollars for four meetings a year; the rise of shareholder activism gave shareholders the power to vote off directors, forcing boards to take oversight seriously.
- He traces the intellectual lineage of engaged ownership back to Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan, who routinely held 20%+ stakes in businesses and replaced management when performance failed — the passive-fund era of Vanguard and BlackRock lost that discipline.
- Pershing Square has not needed to mount a traditional activist campaign in seven years — they are now invited onto boards at the outset because of their track record and credibility.

## Landmark Investments

- General Growth Properties (2008): Ackman bought 25% of the second-largest US mall company for roughly $60 million when the stock fell from $63 to $0.34 amid the financial crisis, betting on the bankruptcy code's rule that equity survives if assets exceed liabilities — the company had $27 billion of debt but strong underlying cash flows (occupancy and net operating income were both up year-over-year in 2007–2008).
- To get on General Growth's board he called a Bucksbaum family member he had briefly met socially in his 20s, who phoned her cousin (the chairman/CEO) — within hours, he had a board seat that Goldman Sachs advisers had told management to deny him.
- General Growth emerged from Chapter 11 in roughly eight months with all creditors paid at par plus accrued interest, employees retained, and equity holders keeping the vast majority of their stake — the stock eventually went from $0.34 to $31 per share.
- A New York City taxi driver who saw Ackman on CNBC at $0.60 per share invested his entire $50,000 life savings in General Growth and made 50 times his money — a story Ackman calls one of the most gratifying moments of his career.
- Canadian Pacific Railway (circa 2011): Ackman bought 12% of Canada's most iconic but worst-run railroad — lowest profit margins and slowest growth in North America, with management blaming weather every quarter — and brought Hunter Harrison, considered the greatest railroader alive, out of retirement to run it.
- Management refused to meet Harrison, triggering a full proxy contest; after Ackman rented the largest hall in Canada and presented a side-by-side comparison of Canadian Pacific and competitor Canadian National, the board lost 99% of the shareholder vote and resigned the night before the meeting.
- The stock appreciated roughly 10 times from Ackman's entry price; Canadian Pacific is now run by Keith Creel, Harrison's protege, whom Ackman considers in some ways superior even to Harrison.
- Chipotle: Ackman bought a stake after a food-safety crisis cut the stock roughly 50% — he viewed the crisis as recoverable, helped recruit Brian Niccol (considered the best operator in quick-service at the time) as CEO, helped move headquarters to California to reboot culture, and the stock rose nearly 10 times from the time Niccol joined.
- Alphabet (Google): Bought when the stock traded at approximately 15 times earnings (~7.5% earnings yield vs. 4% on Treasury bonds) after what Ackman called an "AI scare" — Google's botched Bard demonstration convinced markets the company was behind Microsoft/OpenAI, while Ackman concluded Google was at minimum tied in AI capability and paying nothing for it.

## Biggest Loss and Near-Collapse

- Valeant Pharmaceuticals was Ackman's largest single loss — $4 billion — the result of making a passive investment in a company that violated his core principle of businesses with predictable, durable cash flows; pharmaceutical revenues are inherently volatile due to patent cliffs and drug-pipeline risk.
- The Valeant loss cascaded: Wall Street shorted all of Pershing Square's other holdings on the assumption the firm would be forced to liquidate, creating mark-to-market losses of over 30% in the total portfolio even though most positions were fundamentally sound.
- Elliot Associates (Paul Singer's firm) bought a large stake in Pershing Square's publicly traded vehicle (analogous to Berkshire Hathaway) at a discount, shorted the underlying holdings, and attempted to force a liquidation that would have made both trades profitable — Ackman called it the potential end of his career.
- Simultaneously, Ackman was going through a divorce, carrying litigation from Valeant shareholders, and managing investor redemptions — he described the convergence as one of the lowest points of his life.
- He borrowed $300 million from JPMorgan — breaking his own rule against leverage — to buy enough stock in his public vehicle to prevent Elliot from gaining control; he credits that single move with turning the situation.
- His method for recovering from the bottom: make a small amount of visible progress every single day across litigation, portfolio, and personal life — he describes progress compounding the same way money compounds, invisible in the first 30 days but unmistakable at 90.
- After the Valeant period he chiseled Pershing Square's core investment principles onto a large piece of granite, placed one copy on every employee's desk, and told the team to "hit me with a baseball bat" if the firm ever deviated again — he credits the subsequent six years as the best in the firm's history.

## Herbalife and Carl Icahn

- Herbalife was only Pershing Square's second-ever short position — Ackman described it as a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme that targeted undocumented immigrants and other low-income people with a fake business opportunity disguised as a weight-loss product company.
- He gave what became a famous multi-hour public presentation laying out his fraud thesis, which crushed the stock; the FTC subsequently launched an investigation and eventually settled with Herbalife for $220 million in fines — a Berkeley economist hired as the government's expert told Ackman later that he had been able to prove the pyramid scheme from internal data, but regulators feared losing in court.
- Carl Icahn bought a large Herbalife stake and joined its board — Ackman believes the motivation was personal, not fundamental: Icahn had already litigated with Ackman for eight years over a $4.5 million "schmuck insurance" payment on a Hallwood Realty sale, finally paying after every appeal up to the Supreme Court failed.
- When Icahn called after paying to propose they "be friends and do investing together," Ackman said "Carl, fuck you" — a response he says he does not regret.
- The live CNBC moment when Icahn called into Ackman's interview to argue the other side became what CNBC reported as the most-watched segment in business television history.
- Icahn used his board seat and the company's resources to orchestrate a short squeeze — restricting supply of the stock, driving the price up — forcing Ackman to eventually cover the position at a loss of roughly $1 billion while Icahn made approximately $1 billion.

## Harvard, Claudine Gay, and DEI

- On October 8, 2023 — the morning after the Hamas attack — 34 Harvard student organizations signed a letter stating Israel was solely responsible for Hamas's violence, while Israeli soldiers were still fighting in the south of the country; Ackman said this was the moment he drove to campus to investigate what was happening.
- Faculty told him the protests were rooted in a "DEI ideology" built on an oppressor-oppressed framework: Israel is categorized as an oppressor, Palestinians as the oppressed, and within that framework any act by the oppressed against the oppressor — regardless of how barbaric — is deemed justified.
- He read Christopher Rufo's *America's Cultural Revolution* and concluded that DEI as practiced on campus descends from a post-1960s strategy to infiltrate universities, then government, then corporations — moving through institutions to install an ideological framework derived from Marxist analysis of race and power.
- Only 2% of Harvard faculty identified as conservative in an anonymous survey — Ackman described this as a near-total political monoculture that self-perpetuates because departments hire ideologically compatible candidates.
- A member of the Harvard presidential search committee told Ackman the committee was restricted to considering only candidates approved by the DEI office — information he posted publicly and for which he was accused of racism.
- Claudine Gay testified before Congress in December 2023 alongside the presidents of MIT and Penn; when Representative Elise Stefanik asked whether calling for genocide against Jews violated Harvard's bullying and harassment policies, all three said it "depends on context" — Ackman posted a three-minute clip of that exchange which has accumulated approximately 110 million views.
- Gay's plagiarism was surfaced by Aaron Sibarium and Christopher Rufo — ultimately 76 examples across 8 of her 11 academic papers were identified — though Ackman said he would have preferred she resign over the leadership failures because that would have sent a clearer signal about what Harvard actually values.
- Ackman wanted to fire Gay for failing as a leader and allowing antisemitism to take root; the board instead declared 100% unanimous support for her until the plagiarism scandal forced her hand — he considered this a governance failure by the board, not just a presidential failure.
- Harvard's governance: a 12-member self-perpetuating board of fellows with no shareholder vote mechanism, and a 32-member board of overseers where the required signature threshold was raised from 600 to 3,200 after an activist group nearly got elected — Ackman compared it to a corporation with no mechanism for shareholders to remove directors.
- Ackman attended the screening of Hamas GoPro footage at Harvard, tried to arrange for Gay to see it before her congressional testimony, and offered to fly her to Washington — all overtures were declined.
- Dartmouth's president, who had been in her role the same number of months as Gay, responded to October 7 by immediately convening Arab and Jewish Middle East studies professors for a joint open forum — Ackman cited this as what good leadership looks like.

## Neri Oxman and Media

- Business Insider published a story alleging Neri Oxman — Ackman's wife, a former MIT professor — committed plagiarism, citing four paragraphs in her 330-page dissertation where she cited authors but failed to use quotation marks, plus one missing footnote.
- Oxman acknowledged the clerical errors and apologized gracefully; Business Insider then published a second story titled "Neri Oxman Admits to Plagiarism" — which Ackman argued was defamatory because she admitted to formatting errors, not to academic fraud.
- A 5:19 PM email from Business Insider reporter Catherine Long to Ackman's communications person — not to Oxman or her firm — flagged 24 additional instances including 15 Wikipedia definitions (which Ackman says MIT's own academic handbook explicitly categorizes as common knowledge, not plagiarism) and several hardware/software manual descriptions in footnotes; the story was published 92 minutes later.
- Ackman described the reporter's original framing as explicitly political: "Your wife committed plagiarism — shouldn't she be fired from MIT, just like you caused Claudine Gay to be fired?" He said the intent was to harm him by harming her.
- He escalated to the chairman of Business Insider's board (Henry Blodget), the CEO of parent company Axel Springer, and Henry Kravis of KKR (a controlling shareholder) — after receiving no meaningful corrections, he publicly announced plans to sue for defamation.
- He framed the root cause as digital advertising economics: click-driven revenue incentivizes journalists to produce sensational stories on a 90-minute cycle with no time for subjects to respond, and US defamation law is so favorable to publishers that there is almost no financial deterrent.
- Ackman credited X (formerly Twitter) with giving him the ability to reach 1.2 million followers directly within hours of a damaging article — he estimated his rebuttal to a Washington Post piece about him was seen by 5 million people — calling this a fundamental reversal of the pre-social media dynamic where corrections were buried weeks later on page 40.

## X, Free Speech, and Politics

- Ackman credited Elon Musk's ownership of X with creating the first independently-owned large platform capable of counterbalancing government and mainstream media power — he called this essential for truth and for protecting whistleblowers and dissenters.
- He cited the suppression of the New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story and the silencing of Jay Bhattacharya and others who questioned long COVID lockdowns as examples of what happens when government can influence platforms to suppress speech.
- Ackman described Trump's 2016 election positively: black unemployment reached its lowest rate on record, NATO members increased defense spending under pressure, and China's economic threat was identified early — while crediting Trump's critics for partly driving those outcomes through opposition.
- He held Trump responsible for January 6, arguing he could have stopped the riot early and did not, and faulted his management style of calling every hire "the greatest" and every firing "a total disaster" as incompatible with attracting top talent.
- In early 2024, Ackman was publicly supporting Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips, a three-term Minnesota congressman from a district Republicans had held for 60 years — Ackman helped organize a Twitter Spaces event with 350,000 listeners to build name recognition.
- He co-hosted the Twitter Spaces for Phillips with Elon Musk; Phillips earned 20% of the New Hampshire primary vote starting from near-zero name recognition, which Ackman treated as proof of concept that a centrist alternative was viable against Biden.
- Michael Porter of Harvard Business School wrote what Ackman called a must-read competitive analysis of the American political party system — arguing that party incentives are structurally misaligned with the country's interests, leading to permanent dysfunction.
- Ackman's vision for the US economy mirrors his activist investing thesis: America is a great business that has lost its way — $32 trillion in debt, revenues below expenses, rising interest costs, regulatory bloat, and strained alliances — all fixable with the right leadership.

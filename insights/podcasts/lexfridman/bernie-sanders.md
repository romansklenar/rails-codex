# Bernie Sanders Interview | Lex Fridman Podcast #450

An 83-year-old senator records a stripped-down 62-minute conversation in Burlington, Vermont, arguing that his most "radical" policy ideas — healthcare for all, living wages, fair taxation — command 85–90% public support precisely because the political establishment suppresses discussion of them.

## MLK and the Formation of Sanders's Politics

- Sanders attended the 1963 March on Washington by bus with fellow University of Chicago students; the rally's name was "Jobs and Justice," not just civil rights, shaping his lifelong linkage of racial and economic justice.
- He identifies King's decision to publicly oppose the Vietnam War as an act of exceptional courage: major editorial pages immediately withdrew their praise, and the establishment told King to stay in his lane on civil rights and leave foreign policy alone.
- King was assassinated while supporting AFSCME garbage workers striking for union rights and better wages — Sanders uses this to anchor his view that labor rights and civil rights are inseparable.
- Sanders cites Eugene Victor Debs alongside King as a personal hero: Debs ran for president five times, lost badly every time including from a jail cell for opposing World War I, yet his ideas laid the groundwork for FDR's New Deal.
- The Debs example is Sanders's core rebuttal to the "prophets don't win" critique Obama leveled at him: losing an election while shifting political consciousness can be a more durable win than winning while moderating.

## Oligarchy and the Corruption of Political Money

- Sanders frames the United States as an oligarchy in the same structural sense as Russia: a small number of extremely wealthy families exercise decisive power over economic and political outcomes.
- Three multi-billionaires spent over $200 million combined on Trump's 2024 campaign; Sanders acknowledges Democrats also rely on billionaire donors, just less concentrated.
- The drug industry maintains 1,800 registered lobbyists in Washington — more than three lobbyists per member of Congress — which Sanders identifies as the direct mechanism behind the United States paying the highest prescription drug prices in the world.
- The Pentagon spends roughly $1 trillion per year and is the only federal agency that cannot submit to an independent audit, making fraud, waste, and cost overruns structurally invisible.
- Corruption does not typically mean direct bribery (cash-for-votes is very rare); instead, senators running in large states must raise $50–60 million per race, which forces them to socialize with and financially depend on wealthy donors whose interests shape the politician's worldview.
- Sanders's 2016 campaign averaged $27 per contribution across millions of donors, which he describes as the model for remaining politically independent from large money interests.
- Citizens United (the Supreme Court decision) Sanders calls one of the most "pathetic" in modern history: it held that billionaires have a constitutional right to spend unlimited sums through super PACs to elect candidates.
- His proposed fix: require candidates to demonstrate baseline public support via small donations (e.g., $5 contributions from a threshold number of people), then receive public matching funds with an overall spending cap.

## Healthcare and the Medicare for All Argument

- The United States spends twice as much per person on healthcare as any other major nation, yet 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and life expectancy trails virtually every peer country.
- Sanders estimates 60,000 Americans die unnecessarily each year because they cannot afford to see a doctor when symptoms first appear, waiting until conditions become acute and far more expensive to treat.
- One in four Americans cannot afford to fill prescriptions their doctors write; they skip doses, deteriorate, and ultimately consume emergency care that costs the system far more than the original medication.
- One in four people who receive cancer treatment in the United States either go bankrupt or exhaust their family's financial resources.
- His implementation path for Medicare for All: strengthen existing Medicare (add dental, hearing, and vision), progressively lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55, then 45, then 35, reaching universal coverage in four to five years.
- Higher taxes under this plan are offset by eliminating premiums, co-payments, and deductibles; a self-employed family currently paying $15,000–20,000 per year in insurance costs would pay less overall even after the tax increase.
- Doctors across Vermont told Sanders their patients routinely arrive far sicker than necessary because a $10,000 deductible led them to delay seeking care — the deferred cost falls on the entire system, not just the individual.
- Sanders notes Canada, 50 miles north of Burlington, charges nothing for hospital visits; the same is true across virtually all of Europe; the U.S. model is the global exception, not the norm.

## The 2016 Campaign and the Democratic Establishment

- In the 2016 primary, Sanders had one Senate Democratic colleague supporting him out of 50; zero governors; a handful of House members — the entire party establishment backed Clinton.
- He won 23 states and received millions of votes running as an outsider against the apparatus of the party, demonstrating that the policies he championed had mass support.
- WikiLeaks emails from the DNC confirmed what his campaign suspected: the party actively worked against his candidacy rather than remaining neutral.
- Sanders ran Keith Ellison (now Minnesota Attorney General) for DNC chair after 2016 as an attempt to flip the party's direction; Ellison lost by a narrow margin after the establishment from the president on down mobilized against him.
- He chose to support Clinton in the general election because he viewed Trump as an existential threat to American democracy, not because he agreed with her policy positions.
- According to RAND Corporation data Sanders cites, $50 trillion has been redistributed over the past 50 years from the bottom 90% to the top 1%, while real wages for workers have barely moved despite massive productivity gains.
- CEOs today earn 300 times the median worker salary; three individuals own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population combined — Sanders identifies this as the structural condition that produces working-class anger that Trump exploits.

## Obama: Admiration and Disagreement

- Sanders knows Obama personally and considers him extraordinarily intelligent, one of the best public speakers in American politics, and someone who held the office with a dignity that earned respect even from opponents.
- He credits Obama's 2008 victory as a historic achievement that many Americans had considered impossible and that had transformative social significance beyond any specific policy.
- Obama told Sanders at a private meeting (documented in Ari Rabin-Havt's book The Fighting Soul) that Bernie was "an Old Testament prophet" — able to give moral guidance — but that "prophets don't get to be king," meaning winning power requires compromising positions.
- Sanders rejects this framing directly: he believes prophets who shift the Overton window can accomplish more than kings who win elections by moderating, using Debs-to-FDR as the historical example.
- Obama said publicly that if starting over he would pursue Medicare for All single-payer, but at the time concluded the Affordable Care Act was the achievable maximum — Sanders disagrees with this sequencing logic.
- Both Obama and Sanders opposed the Iraq War publicly before running for president; Sanders notes this courage becomes harder to act on once inside the system, given the lobbying power of the military-industrial complex.

## Capitalism, Wealth Concentration, and the Nordic Model

- Sanders does not advocate abolishing capitalism or having the government run every business; he wants government to ensure universal access to healthcare, housing, quality education from childcare through university, and retirement security.
- His book "It's Okay to Be Angry About Capitalism" targets what he calls "hypercapitalism" or "ubercapitalism" — not the innovation engine of markets, but the concentration of ownership that now lets 5,000–10,000 ultra-wealthy families exert economic control over 7 billion people globally.
- In Denmark, Finland, and Norway: no hospital bills, six weeks of paid vacation (Germany's standard), universal paid family and medical leave, college tuition-free or near-free — all coexist with thriving private sectors.
- Sanders asked Bill Gates (the third-wealthiest person in the United States, worth over $100 billion) whether becoming a billionaire motivated his programming work; Gates said no — he was motivated by the work itself, not the money.
- He uses this to argue that innovation incentives do not require billionaire-level wealth accumulation; scientists working on Alzheimer's and cancer drugs are not motivated by the prospect of becoming billionaires.
- Elon Musk is acknowledged as "a brilliant guy who works like a dog" with genuine innovations — Sanders separates admiration for Musk's technical contributions from opposition to the role billionaire money plays in his political activities.
- The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour for years; Sanders advocates raising it to $17 per hour, arguing that working 40 hours a week in the richest country in history should not produce poverty-level income.

## Personal Finances and Staying Connected to Working-Class Reality

- When Sanders entered politics, his net worth was approximately $1,100.
- He now earns roughly $175,000 per year as a senator and owns three properties: a Burlington home in a middle-class neighborhood, a Washington DC row house (standard for senators serving multi-year terms), and a modest camp on Lake Champlain.
- His net worth of approximately $2 million derives almost entirely from two bestselling books, including the New York Times bestseller on capitalism.
- He drives a car that is 11 years old; his jewelry consists of a solar watch and a wedding ring; he describes having no interest in Rolex watches, luxury cars, or expensive vacations.
- The material change wealth made: he no longer lies awake worrying about paying the electric bill or affording a doctor visit — he describes this elimination of economic anxiety as "enormous" and the primary concrete benefit of financial security.
- He still chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) committee; he has joined picket lines and been present at dozens of strikes across the country as part of his committee work.

## AOC, the Progressive Caucus, and the Democratic Party's Internal War

- The House Progressive Caucus now has nearly 100 members, led by Representative Pramila Jayapal (Washington); it includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and many others who are disproportionately young, women, and people of color from working-class backgrounds.
- Sanders says the fundamental conflict inside the Democratic Party is between its corporate wing (which raises money from wealthy individuals and large corporations) and its progressive wing (which represents working-class constituencies on healthcare, wages, housing, and taxation).
- He believes Trump's electoral success is primarily a symptom of Democrats failing to address working-class economic anger — not evidence that working-class voters actually support tax cuts for billionaires.
- AOC worked as a bartender in the Bronx and helped her mother clean houses before running for Congress; Sanders credits his 2016 presidential campaign with inspiring her candidacy.
- She defeated Joe Crowley, a senior Democratic Party figure, with no money, running a purely grassroots door-knocking campaign — which Sanders points to as proof the model works.
- Sanders considered running in 2024 for approximately five minutes, deciding that challenging Biden would have split the party and created an easy path to a Trump victory, contradicting the progressive movement's stated principle that "it's not about me, it's about us."

## Mortality and Personal Reflection

- At 83, Sanders describes himself as not afraid of death but genuinely afraid of infirmity — loss of physical capacity and cognitive sharpness.
- He had a heart attack five years prior (around 2019) and describes the experience of his body failing him for the first time as "stunning" — an unexpected confrontation with physical limits after decades of robust health.
- He expresses empathy for people in nursing homes losing mobility and mental agility, identifying it as qualitatively different from the fear of death itself.
- Sanders describes his legacy as the dozens of progressive candidates now serving in Congress, on city councils, and in state legislatures who were inspired by his campaigns to enter politics.
- The grassroots movement he helped build has already delivered concrete policy results: the American Rescue Plan (which he helped write as Senate Budget Committee chair during COVID) cut childhood poverty by 40% through the child tax credit, kept hospitals and colleges solvent, and funded vaccination infrastructure.

## Hope, Grassroots Change, and the Role of Corporate Media

- Sanders draws hope from seeing multiracial, multigenerational crowds at rallies across every state — people who are not interested in becoming billionaires but want to improve conditions for others.
- He frames historical social progress — women's suffrage, gay rights, civil rights — as proof that organized grassroots pressure, not individual heroic leaders, is what moves political systems.
- He praises independent podcasts (implicitly including Fridman's) for creating space to discuss major issues — healthcare costs, campaign finance, the military-industrial complex — that corporate media consistently underrepresents not because reporters lie but because the institutional incentives suppress the topics.
- His closing call to action: citizens should directly ask candidates at town halls whether they support overturning Citizens United and moving to public election funding, making that a litmus-test question rather than waiting for leaders to raise it voluntarily.

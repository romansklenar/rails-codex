# Omar Suleiman: Palestine, Gaza, Oct 7, Israel, Resistance, Faith & Islam | Lex Fridman Podcast #411

A Palestinian-American Islamic scholar makes the case that October 7th was a predictable outcome of 75 years of occupation, apartheid, and American impunity, while drawing on MLK, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and Islamic ethics to frame the moral stakes of the conflict.

## October 7th in Context

- Suleiman's first reaction on October 7th was not surprise but anticipation of mass Palestinian casualties, describing the cycle as "one Israeli casualty leads to hundreds of Palestinian casualties."
- In 2023 alone, over 600 Palestinians had already been killed before October 7th — that death toll received almost no Western coverage.
- Israel's government in 2023 approved 13,000 new settler units, the most in the occupation's history, under what Suleiman calls the most extremist Israeli cabinet ever formed.
- Human Rights Watch (2021) and Amnesty International (2022) each formally determined Israel meets the legal threshold of apartheid before the October 7th attacks.
- Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist, was killed on camera in 2022; after investigation confirmed Israeli responsibility, the US took no action and her funeral procession was attacked.
- Israeli ministers openly called for removal of Palestinians and expansion from the river to the sea before and after October 7th — Suleiman argues this was policy, not fringe rhetoric.
- He describes Gaza's pre-war status as worse than an open-air prison: inmates in prisons are not routinely bombed with some of the world's most sophisticated weapons.

## Wael Al-Dahdouh and the Targeting of Journalists

- Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh lost his wife, two children, and a grandchild in an Israeli airstrike while he was reporting on TV.
- He returned to the camera the same day his family was killed, then was himself struck by another airstrike that severed his arm.
- His cameraman Samer Abudaqa bled out over several hours while snipers shot anyone trying to reach them.
- A separate airstrike later killed another of Al-Dahdouh's sons who was driving with a friend.
- Suleiman notes that over 100 journalists had been killed in Gaza by the time of this recording, more than in any conflict in history, with international watchdogs finding evidence of intentional targeting.
- Suleiman argues that if Al-Dahdouh were not Palestinian, he would be on the cover of Time Magazine as the most celebrated journalist in the world.
- Western journalists in Gaza were required to submit footage for Israeli review before publication, which Suleiman describes as state-controlled propaganda.

## The Killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume and Domestic Anti-Palestinian Violence

- Six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American boy, was stabbed 26 times in his home in Plainfield Township, Illinois, the Saturday after October 7th.
- His landlord, "Uncle Joe," had previously been kind to the family and given Wadea toys; Wadea ran toward him saying "Uncle Joe" as he was being attacked.
- His mother Hanaan was stabbed seven or eight times first and managed to escape to call 911; she heard Wadea say "Oh no" before he was killed.
- The attacker cited President Biden's repetition of a debunked claim about 40 beheaded Israeli babies as part of the anti-Palestinian propaganda he had been consuming.
- The White House later retracted the beheaded-babies claim in a statement Suleiman says "no one reads."
- Wadea's story disappeared from mainstream news within a day; Suleiman contrasts this with the front-page coverage received by the unrelated stabbing of Detroit synagogue president Samantha Woll, which was later determined not to be a hate crime.
- Suleiman attended Christchurch memorials in 2019 (50 Muslims killed) and found a single unified world voice of condemnation; at Wadea's funeral, family members shouted "Joe Biden, you did this."

## US Political Failures — Biden and Trump

- Suleiman says James Baldwin described Israel as a colonial entity created as an extension of US policy to serve as a military base at the gates of the Middle East.
- The US has blocked every meaningful UN resolution holding Israel accountable and has bypassed Congress to replenish Israel's arsenal during the Gaza war.
- Biden's first use of the word "Palestinian" in the context of the conflict was to accuse Palestinians of lying about the death toll — a claim later contradicted by Israeli intelligence, which said the real count was higher than Gaza's Health Ministry reported.
- At the time of recording, 67% of Americans supported a ceasefire, including three-fourths of Democratic voters and half of Republican voters, yet only a handful of congressmembers had called for one.
- Suleiman says the Muslim community will vote against politicians who failed to call for a ceasefire, describing this not as a radical stance but as a bare minimum of conscience.
- He criticizes what he calls "Progressive except Palestine" (PeP) — activists who support policing reform and border human rights domestically but apply the opposite framing to Palestinians.
- Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and promised to be more unapologetic in backing Israel unconditionally; Suleiman treats the conflict as a bipartisan failure rather than a reason to favor either party.

## The November 4th Ceasefire March in Washington

- Approximately 400,000 people marched on Washington on November 4th — one of the largest marches in US history — and received virtually no coverage in mainstream American media.
- A smaller Stand With Israel rally held between the two large Palestine marches was live-streamed on multiple news networks with bipartisan congressional participation and celebrity presence.
- The International Court of Justice streamed Israel's defense against the genocide case live on multiple US outlets but completely omitted South Africa's prior presentation of evidence the day before.
- Suleiman describes the protest coalition as the most diverse he has ever seen: Jewish Voice for Peace, If Not Now, Never Again Means For Anyone, Native American groups, Christians, and Muslims.
- At Columbia University, two former IDF soldiers sprayed Palestinian protesters with skunk water; one affected student had showered 11 times and still could not remove the smell.
- Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism, Suleiman argues, noting that Palestinians are themselves a Semitic people, and that his community has stood in front of synagogues to oppose antisemitism.

## Netanyahu, Occupation, and the Question of Self-Defense

- Suleiman says Netanyahu has campaigned since the beginning of his career on explicit promises that there would never be a Palestinian state and that Gaza would be eliminated — this is not new policy but the open execution of longstanding goals.
- He argues Netanyahu is prolonging the war to extend his time in office and that his actual motivation is personal political survival, not hostage recovery or Israeli security.
- Even moderate Israeli alternatives like Yair Lapid pursued equally aggressive policies against Palestinians, demonstrating that the problem is the occupation itself, not any single leader.
- Suleiman rejects the framing of "Israel's right to defend itself" by citing legal scholar Noura Erakat: Israel as an occupier is bound by occupation law and has a duty to protect those it occupies, not a right to assault them.
- Gaza meets every international legal standard for occupation despite the Israeli troop withdrawal — Israel controls Gaza's air, sea, import/export, movement, and identity documentation.
- Israel has violated over 63 UN resolutions without accountability, a record Suleiman attributes directly to US obstruction of international justice.

## The Ethics of Resistance — MLK, Malcolm X, and Palestinian Methods

- Suleiman taught a course at Southern Methodist University on MLK, Malcolm X, Islam, and the Civil Rights Movement, regularly giving students unmarked quotes to assign — they almost always misattributed Malcolm's to Martin and vice versa.
- Malcolm X never personally participated in violence; his argument was that it is hypocritical to demand nonviolence from the oppressed while placing no restraint on the oppressor.
- Malcolm was the first major African-American leader to speak publicly against the Vietnam War; Martin Luther King Jr. followed.
- Malcolm visited Khan Yunis in 1964 and wrote an essay connecting Zionism to American imperialism — the very area he visited is now under heavy bombardment.
- During the Great Return March, Palestinian protesters walked nonviolently to the border wall; Israeli snipers documented "knee counts," with at least one soldier recording 45 knee shots. The AP published this documentation.
- BDS boycotts, modeled on the South African anti-apartheid movement, are labeled antisemitic — Suleiman sees this as evidence that every form of Palestinian resistance, violent or nonviolent, is systematically delegitimized.
- James Cone's book "Malcolm & Martin: Dreams and Nightmares" frames Martin as trying to liberate white people from their racism while Malcolm tried to liberate Black people from the effects of it; Suleiman sees both functions as necessary.

## Palestinian Prisoners, Hostages, and the Abraham Accords

- Congresswoman Betty McCollum sponsored a bill for years penalizing Israel for detaining Palestinian child prisoners; it never gained traction in mainstream American politics despite documented solitary confinement and sexual violence against minors.
- During the four-day truce, 150 Palestinian prisoners were released; Israel immediately arrested 135 more Palestinians in the West Bank.
- Suleiman rejects the "Israeli hostages vs. Palestinian prisoners" framing as already encoding a moral judgment — all 2.2 million people in Gaza are hostages under blockade.
- The Abraham Accords are described as arms deals dressed in a holy name from which Palestinians are entirely absent, negotiating their fate without them.
- Palestinian self-determination was voted against by the US in the UN even as the US publicly used the phrase in its inconsequential statements.

## Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam, and the Rise of Interest in the Faith

- Al-Aqsa is one of Islam's three sanctuaries (alongside Mecca and Medina) and was the first Qibla — the direction of prayer before Muslims faced Mecca — for the first half of Islamic history.
- The Night Journey (Al-Isra' wal-Mi'raj) describes the Prophet Muhammad leading all the prophets in prayer at Al-Aqsa before ascending to the heavens, making the site central to Islamic theology.
- Young Palestinians are generally barred from praying at Al-Aqsa even if they live within the occupied territories; worshipers have been tear-gassed and attacked with skunk water during Ramadan nights.
- The Prophet Muhammad said that the dignity of one believer is worth more than the Ka'bah itself; Suleiman applies this to argue one child's life in Gaza outweighs the sanctity of any physical holy site.
- After October 7th, Quran TikTok trends emerged in which non-Muslims read the Quran for the first time, drawn by what they saw as unexplainable spiritual resilience in Gaza's people.
- Suleiman reports unprecedented numbers of people converting to Islam and visiting mosques in the period following October 7th, inspired by Palestinian dignity under extreme suffering.
- Converting to Islam takes 20 seconds — the Shahada, testifying to the oneness of God and Muhammad as his final prophet — and implies acceptance of six articles of faith including belief in Jesus, Moses, and Abraham as genuine prophets.

## Interfaith Fractures and Islam's Relationship to Other Faiths

- Islam holds that all prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad — delivered the same monotheistic message with different legislative details for different times; the Quran instructs believers not to distinguish between prophets.
- Christian Zionism is a root cause of unconditional US support for Israel, which Suleiman finds particularly devastating because Israel has bombed some of the oldest churches in Gaza and killed Palestinian Christians.
- Justin Amash, a Republican congressman of Palestinian Christian heritage, posted about his family dying in a church bombing — an event that shocked many US Christians who had not connected Palestinian identity with Christian identity.
- Suleiman cites Reverend Munther Isaac's Christmas sermon "Jesus in the Rubble" from Bethlehem as a profound expression of Palestinian Christian witness.
- On Islam and violence: the Quran contains fewer verses about war than either the Old or New Testament by percentage; if Muslims believed in killing non-believers wherever found, "mankind would not exist — there are two billion of us."
## Hope, Faith, and the Long View

- Suleiman's sustaining Quranic verse during the crisis is from the chapter of Mary: "Your Lord does not forget" — grounding hope in a divine account rather than in political institutions.
- He describes Palestinians in Gaza as never having been "deluded by the material world" because they never had it, and therefore connected to a spiritual certainty that sustains them through conditions no material calculation could justify.
- He believes the nation-state model is becoming unsustainable given growing refugee populations and climate displacement, and hopes the 20-to-40-year trajectory is toward seeing people as people rather than as threats.
- MLK wrote that if America were to suffer a "spiritual death," the autopsy would read Vietnam; Suleiman says the autopsy today would read Gaza.
- Malcolm X's 1964 essay on Zionism connected it to American imperialism — written from Khan Yunis, the same city now under heavy bombardment sixty years later.
- Despite everything, Suleiman says he sees light, not darkness, in young Palestinians: "You can't bomb Palestine out of our hearts. You cannot starve Palestine out of our hearts."

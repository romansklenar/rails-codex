# Neri Oxman: Biology, Art, and Science of Design & Engineering with Nature | Lex Fridman Podcast #394

## Biomass, Anthropomass, and the Case for Growing Everything

- Ron Milo, a professor at the Weizmann Institute, identified 2020 as the crossover year when anthropomass — all human-made objects including plastics, concrete, asphalt, and buildings — exceeded total global biomass for the first time in history.
- Oxman coined the term "material ecology" in 2005 to describe a design philosophy in which all manufactured objects are treated as part of the ecological system and designed to have a positive impact on it.
- Her "Turing test for material ecology" is whether a product can be grown rather than assembled — she frames it as: if you could grow an iPhone or a car, what would that world look like?
- Since the first computer, humanity has gained one trillion times the computational power, 26.5 trillion times the bandwidth, and 11.5 quintillion times the memory — Oxman asks what would happen if nature itself had access to that bandwidth.
- Her company Oxman is developing a product that starts from CO2 or methane, becomes a worn or used object, and then biodegrades into the soil to grow an edible fruit plant — fully biodegradable, biocompatible, and bio-renewable from start to finish.
- The current biologically-derived fashion industry solves only one link in the chain — mycelium leather or cellulose textile — then reverts to synthetic glues and coatings at the assembly stage; Oxman's goal is to solve the entire product lifecycle with only microbes and robots.
- Oxman frames the company's mission across three scales: the molecular scale (decoding a universal language across all five kingdoms of life), the product scale (growing fully circular wearables), and the architectural scale (structures that augment rather than deplete nature).

## Computational Templating and Co-Fabrication with Living Organisms

- The Mediated Matter Group at MIT built a 6-meter-tall silk pavilion for MoMA using 17,532 silkworms, each of which produces roughly one mile of silk thread — the pavilion required three months to build and ended up in MoMA's permanent collection under curator Paul Antonelli.
- The silkworm pavilion used three simultaneous templating strategies: physical templates (water-soluble mesh scaffolds), environmental templates (a KUKA robotic arm varying heat and light to guide silkworm movement), and chemical templates (pheromones used in other projects to guide bees without a queen).
- Silkworms are not social organisms — they have zero natural communication across individuals — but when placed on computational templates they exhibited swarm-like cooperative behavior, varying fiber density and transparency as though produced by a coordinated colony.
- The key discovery enabling the pavilion was that silkworms placed on flat surfaces below 21 millimeters spin flat patches rather than three-dimensional cocoons, allowing the team to build the dome as a set of modular flat panels without disrupting the animals' natural behavior.
- Oxman's ethical rule for co-fabrication: the design must be a win for the organism as well as for the human application — she refused a Japanese researcher's offer to create glow-in-the-dark silk by transplanting spider genes into silkworms, calling it an unacceptable transgenic modification of an already human-engineered creature.
- The domesticated silk moth was engineered by humans 4,000 years ago to be unable to fly and incapable of surviving in the wild — approximately 1,000 cocoons are exterminated per shirt produced in India and China's sericulture industry, a scale of abuse Oxman wants to move beyond.
- Her distinction between templating and emergence: if you can predict what the system will produce, it does not count as emergence — true emergence happens when the biological agent assumes agency over the computational code rather than merely following it.

## Engineering with Bacteria: The Vespers Project and Hybrid Living Materials

- The Vespers project created 15 death masks in three sets of five — masks of the past, present, and future — using E. coli engineered to produce pigments that grow patterns on the surface of 3D-printed resin objects at a resolution of 20 microns per voxel.
- The masks of the past were embedded with natural minerals including gold; the masks of the present allowed surface pigments to migrate into internal channels and pockets within the volume of the mask, where bacteria then re-created the original pattern in three dimensions.
- Vespers was a platform technology: having demonstrated pigment production at 20-micron voxel resolution, Oxman's team immediately asked whether the same method could work with antibiotics, melanin, or other bioactive compounds at the same precision.
- A student on the team, Rachael, developed a PhD thesis and new material category from the project called Hybrid Living Materials (HLMs) — the class of composite objects that are partially synthetic and partially inhabited by living organisms producing functional outputs.
- The Aguahoja pavilion on the roof of SF MoMA was built entirely from shrimp shells (chitosan), apple skins, cellulose from tree pulp, and water — it contained 40,000 embedded calories and was connected to a live weather feed so visitors could watch it biodegrade in real time.
- The energy budget for Aguahoja included the electricity consumed by 3D printers and computers during fabrication — Oxman's design principle requires accounting for the entire ecological system, from raw material source to end-of-life, not just the object itself.
- Oxman's project principle: every project must simultaneously be eligible for MoMA and the cover of Nature or Science — she does not separate art from science and insists each major work produce genuinely new knowledge about the organism or material being used.

## Bees in Space and the Synthetic Apiary

- NASA sent bees to space in 1982 and they returned neither reproductive nor fully alive; Oxman's team designed a miniaturized life-support capsule for a Blue Origin New Shepard mission that returned a queen bee and her retinue alive, healthy, and reproductive.
- The synthetic apiary — built in a co-op in Somerville near MIT — was a controlled indoor environment maintaining perpetual spring conditions (regulated temperature, humidity, and light) that proved bees could survive and reproduce through Boston winters when normally 80% die.
- The space mission biolab used the Nasonov pheromone (the queen's guiding signal) released inside the capsule to maintain colony cohesion in microgravity — the experiment ended with a paper in Nature.
- A key scientific discovery from the bee work: it was previously believed bees do not recycle wax; by feeding the bees gold and silver nanoparticles and then detecting those particles in new comb, the team proved that bees do recycle wax.
- The robotic queen concept — a device that releases synthetic queen pheromones to guide bee movement in the absence of a real queen — was a form of chemical templating: guiding a living superorganism through molecular signals rather than physical structures.
- Oxman's definition of empowerment, formalized by a team member named Christopher, is mathematical: an agent is empowered when the entropy of the distribution of all possible states is high (many options available) while the entropy of a single chosen state given a specific action is low (each action has a clear consequence).

## Plant Communication and the Molecular Language of Nature

- When grass is cut, the leaves emit green leaf volatiles (GLVs) — molecular signals that communicate distress to neighboring grass blades, effectively warning them that cutting is occurring; this is a real chemical language, not a metaphor.
- The molecular footprint of a rose or other plant during nighttime is chemically distinct from its daytime footprint — plants have circadian molecular rhythms that correspond to circadian biological states, including what Oxman describes as a state of rest at 4:00 AM.
- Current precision agriculture uses drones to photograph crops and identify visual signs of disease — by the time a plant looks bad from above it is already too late; decoding the plant's molecular distress signals would allow prediction before visible symptoms appear.
- Oxman's first commercial product for the molecular space is a "functionalized fragrance" — a scent designed not only for human use but capable of interacting with specific plant species, potentially empowering plants to respond to molecular inputs rather than just receiving human aesthetic pleasure.
- Producing 5 mL of a bio-derived rose fragrance currently requires destroying approximately 10,000 rose bushes — Oxman views this as an unsustainable extraction model and uses it as the problem her functionalized fragrance approach is designed to solve.
- Her lab is building physical growth capsules (designed since 2019, under construction as of the episode) where each sealed chamber can simultaneously apply top-down environmental control (light, humidity, temperature) and bottom-up genetic regulation — a combination she believes has never been built before.
- Each capsule functions as a programmable biodiversity chamber: by dialing in environmental parameters corresponding to a historical time and place (e.g., Ohio, December 31, 1981, 5:00 AM), the team can attempt to recreate or predict what specific organisms would produce in those conditions.

## AGI, Nature, and the Next Frontier After Intelligence

- Oxman's progression from data to meaning: data enables information, information enables knowledge, knowledge enables intelligence (problem-solving and adaptation), intelligence enables wisdom (insight about the world), and wisdom can lead to spiritual awareness that charts new territory.
- She argues that AGI operates as a "self-recursive third-derivative Wikipedia" — language generating language generating language — but that its apparent novelty may represent genuine emergence rather than mere recombination.
- Her concern about AGI is not speed or power but the moment when an AGI is indistinguishable from a specific human person — when a child cannot tell whether they are talking to their parent or to the AGI — which she calls "the end of human agency."
- Her optimistic reframing: the end of human agency in the digital domain could mark the beginning of agency for nature — if all of human consciousness and language modeling were uploaded and given to the natural world, nature might use that bandwidth in ways we cannot predict.
- She proposes a thought experiment: what if you could ask a ChatGPT-style question, but the answer arrived through directed evolution over 10,000 years? Switching the timescale entirely changes what kinds of knowledge become accessible.
- Michael Levine's concept of "gentle material" — material that has agency — is directly relevant to Oxman's synthesis: once biological materials can assume their own rules post-templating, the resulting systems behave the way we want AGI to behave, but in the physical and biological domain rather than the digital one.
- She draws a distinction between wisdom in nature (operating on evolutionary timescales, accumulated across billions of years) and intelligence in AI (operating on millisecond timescales, processing all of recorded human language) — the goal of Oxman's company is to interface these two radically different modes of knowing.

## Beauty, Emergence, and the Philosophy of Design

- Oxman's definition of beauty: something that has agency is beautiful — she cites Buckminster Fuller's principle that if a solution is not beautiful when complete, it was probably wrong; beauty functions as an objective signal about whether a design achieved its purpose.
- Her distinction between empowerment and emergence: empowerment is directional (a force with a vector), emergence is multi-directional; empowerment can occur without emergence, but emergence does not happen without some form of prior empowerment.
- The future of design is "soft control" — designing highly controlled systems that are explicitly engineered to enable the loss of control, allowing biological diversity to arise the way wings and scales arise in evolution without a reward function dictating outcomes.
- Imperfection is not merely acceptable but functionally necessary: in the Vespers masks, apparent symmetry conceals deliberate asymmetries — "imperfections by design" — because nothing in nature is perfectly symmetrical and perfection signals the absence of life.
- She describes a flaw as "increased surface area" — physically or emotionally, a flaw introduces a new dimension that allows connection: like a cracked brick that holds mortar better, human vulnerability creates the surface area through which relationships can form.
- Oxman's project selection criterion requires simultaneous novelty across multiple disciplines — if a project is novel in synthetic biology, robotics, material science, and computational design at the same time, novelty in the final output is mathematically guaranteed.
- Fate, in the definition she shares, is the ratio of who you are to who you want to be — and design, like personal growth, is the ongoing project of narrowing that ratio through directed action and creative agency.

## Extinction, Timescales, and the Definition of Life

- Earth has experienced five mass extinctions; Oxman considers we are currently in the sixth, noting that the first extinction 440 million years ago — when the first spore-bearing plants clung to rocks and generated 60 times more phosphorus than soil without them, choking oxygen from the oceans — was simultaneously the death event that created the nutrient conditions for all subsequent plant life.
- Through the lens of a bacterium, a lifetime may be a millisecond; through the lens of a redwood, life may be defined as ten generations; through the lens of an AGI, life might encompass all of human civilization — the definition of life is inseparable from the timescale of the organism asking the question.
- The civilizational mismatch between human product cycles and biological timescales is the central design problem she is trying to solve: a redwood requires hundreds of years to grow its cellulose channels; a Christmas tree is consumed for one night and discarded.
- Her company is not afraid to design on timescales of thousands of years — she explicitly states this in response to capitalism's demand for short product cycles, treating it as a challenge to be solved rather than a constraint to be accepted.

## Advice, Creativity, and the Meaning of a Life's Work

- Oxman left medical school at Hebrew University on the day her grandmother died, choosing to pursue architecture at the Architectural Association in London — she describes it as a door closing that opened other possibilities, made possible by letting go of one dream to pursue another.
- Her creative process involves deliberate peripheral attention: she will listen to Leonard Bernstein recordings, read a Nature paper, and re-read War and Peace simultaneously, allowing timeless problems and timely technologies to collide rather than forcing a direct connection.
- When beginning the Mandela Pavilion (built using melanin and shown at SF MoMA), the team read the chapter on the whiteness of the whale from Moby Dick — the concept of the other, the albino, the different — which led them to melanin as both subject and material.
- She recommends hiring people who are "dreamers addicted to reality" rather than "realists addicted to dreams" — people who have both idealistic vision and deep disciplinary skill, ideally with a double major in two fields whose combination makes no obvious sense.
- Her interview method: ask candidates about childhood memories, music, and moments of connection — "you can learn a lot about a person's future by spending time hearing them talk about their past."
- The distinction she draws for young people between a career and a calling: a career is imposed from outside and top-down; a calling is directional and innately self-generated — similarly, happiness is external and fluctuating, but joy is something you can sustain even through sadness.
- Creative solitude is a prerequisite for community, not its opposite — she distinguishes being alone (a choice) from being lonely (an absence) and argues that pockets of solitude are necessary to reset the "ratio" of who you are to who you want to be.

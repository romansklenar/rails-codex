# Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Ukraine, War, Peace, Putin, Trump, NATO, and Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #456

A sitting wartime president speaks without a script about the mechanics of negotiating with Putin, the failures of every prior security guarantee Ukraine was given, and why he believes Trump — not goodwill — is the only lever capable of stopping Russia.

## Language as a Political Act

- Zelenskyy conducted the interview primarily in Ukrainian despite being more fluent in Russian, because Russia justified its invasion as defense of Russian speakers.
- He addressed Russians in Russian on the first day of the invasion and received zero response, which he describes as a defining moment of disillusionment.
- He did not ban Russian in Ukraine — he speaks it in the interview — but says Ukrainians "disrespect Russian now because of Russians," not the language itself.
- The conversation ran across Ukrainian, Russian, and English simultaneously, with ElevenLabs AI used to produce overdubbed versions in all three languages.
- Zelenskyy's stated reason for choosing Ukrainian over Russian with Trump in mind: "I think it is far better for Donald Trump to hear my English, not my Russian."

## Family History and World War II

- Zelenskyy's grandfather graduated from a military academy, fought through all of World War II, was wounded multiple times, and received more than 30 medals.
- His grandfather's four brothers all went to war; he was the only one to survive.
- His grandfather's entire family — including his father, who was head of the village — was executed by occupying forces and buried in a mass grave, some buried alive.
- After the war his grandfather became a police colonel in criminal investigation; he never believed another such war was possible.
- Zelenskyy draws a direct parallel: the 2022 invasion began around 4 a.m. with missile strikes, the same pattern as the German invasion on June 22, 1941.
- He compares Putin's "Russian World" ideology to early Nazi rhetoric about one race and one nation before radicalization, noting Hitler initially spoke of economic progress before turning genocidal.

## The Morning of February 24, 2022

- Zelenskyy woke to missile strikes at approximately 3:40–3:45 a.m. and told his wife to get the children ready before leaving for his office.
- He describes leaving his family as the moment he "stopped being a father" — his wife took responsibility for the children while he took responsibility for the state.
- As supreme commander, he immediately began issuing orders; trucks drove through cities distributing weapons to civilians to defend the capital.
- He addressed the public three to five times per day and built a unified media platform called Marathon aggregating all Ukrainian news agencies to prevent information collapse.
- On the first day, he went outside the presidential office and filmed himself on the street — touching objects — to disprove Russian disinformation that he had fled on a green screen.
- Lukashenko called on day two and said, "This is not me — the missiles launched from my territory are Putin's," then suggested Ukraine retaliate by striking the Mozyr Oil Refinery; Zelenskyy told him: "You are a murderer too."

## Failed Ceasefire Negotiations and the Normandy Meeting

- In December 2019, Zelenskyy sat down with Putin at the Élysée Palace in Paris alongside Macron and Merkel and negotiated three agreements: a gas transit contract, an all-for-all prisoner exchange, and a ceasefire.
- The gas contract was signed because Putin needed the money; the prisoner exchange happened; the ceasefire was violated within approximately one month.
- Zelenskyy called Putin after the ceasefire broke down and asked him directly: "We agreed on a ceasefire. This wasn't toilet paper." Putin said it "couldn't be" enforced.
- After a few calls with no result, Russia stopped answering the phone entirely; Ukraine had no further direct contact.
- Ukraine sent official diplomatic letters three times to all Budapest Memorandum signatories after 2014 requesting consultations; none of the five signatories — US, Russia, UK, France, China — responded.
- He describes the Minsk agreements as the second car on a "train of wastepaper" following the Budapest Memorandum, both pieces of paper that provided no real security.
- In 2008 at the Bucharest NATO summit, President Bush supported Ukrainian membership; Merkel opposed it and forced consensus against an invitation, which Zelenskyy cites as a pivotal missed moment.

## The Budapest Memorandum and Security Guarantees

- Ukraine surrendered its nuclear arsenal under the Budapest Memorandum, the third-largest in the world at the time, in exchange for security "assurances" — not guarantees — from the US, Russia, UK, France, and China.
- Zelenskyy draws a sharp distinction between "assurance" and "guarantee": the memorandum contained only a consultation obligation, which no signatory honored.
- His central argument: "You have unleashed the hands of a nuclear power against us. Today we are at war because of that."
- His minimum condition for any ceasefire: NATO membership or equivalent US-backed security guarantees for the territory Ukraine currently controls — not the five occupied regions.
- He accepts a phased framework — NATO for controlled territory now, diplomatic path for occupied territories later — and argues NATO also constrains Ukraine from revenge attacks on Russia: "NATO is stopping us too."

## Conditions for a Ceasefire and Peace Framework

- Zelenskyy's sequencing: first agree with Trump, then bring in Europe, then approach Russia — not a simultaneous three-way summit as Fridman imagines.
- A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous: Putin would use the pause to rebuild and return with a larger, better-equipped force in a future Trump or post-Trump term.
- He proposes using the $300 billion in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine's own weapons procurement from US defense companies — "we don't need gifts, we'll buy."
- The second security layer is sustained energy sanctions, cutting Russian oil and gas revenue and replacing it with cheaper American LNG — "Putin won't have so much money for the war."
- North Korea had already sent 12,000 soldiers to Russia by January 2025; approximately 3,800 were killed or wounded; soldiers were burning their own faces to avoid identification.
- North Korea supplied Russia with 3.7 million artillery rounds, compared to Europe's contribution of 1 million rounds to Ukraine in a full year.
- Ukraine's army of 980,000 is the largest in Europe; France, second largest, has approximately 200,000 — meaning Europe without the US cannot resist a sustained Russian offensive.

## Assessment of Putin and Russia

- Zelenskyy rejects the premise that Putin loves his country: "What is his country? He happened to consider Ukraine his country."
- He cites Chechnya — a million people killed, a different people, language, and faith — as evidence that Putin destroys rather than loves the people he claims to protect.
- Russia has suffered 788,000 killed or wounded soldiers — a figure Zelenskyy states as fact, noting these include soldiers from ethnicities that don't speak Russian.
- He does not believe Putin wants to end the war: "Don't wait for Putin to want to stop. Pressure him so he is forced to stop — that is the difference."
- Putin's strategic goal is not territory per se but preventing Ukraine from existing as an independent state, which would prove the Russian World ideology false.
- Russia's playbook: create frozen conflicts (e.g., Abkhazia in Georgia) that make countries ineligible for EU and NATO membership, keeping them in Russia's orbit; Zelenskyy predicted Moldova would be the next target by April 2025.
- North Korean soldiers gaining combat experience with large-scale drone warfare and missile operations will bring those skills home, creating security risks for Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

## Donald Trump and US Politics

- Zelenskyy believes Trump won in 2024 because he showed physical and mental strength through an unprecedented rally schedule — "he is young here, in his brain."
- Trump's promise to end the war resonated in Ukraine; Zelenskyy says Trump may have the highest approval rating of any foreign leader among Ukrainians as of early 2025.
- His key ask of Trump: ensure he receives an accurate picture of the battlefield and of Putin's actual intentions before making any deal, not relying on intermediaries with pro-Russian biases.
- He worries that if Trump brokers a ceasefire without security guarantees and Putin attacks again in year five, both Trump's legacy and Ukraine lose — Trump as the 2025 equivalent of Zelenskyy in 2019.
- He did not attend Trump's January 20 inauguration because he requires a formal personal invitation, not a public one — contrasting himself with Putin: "We did not invite him. He came to us."

## Corruption and Accountability

- Zelenskyy imprisoned Ihor Kolomoyskyi, described as the most influential Ukrainian oligarch since independence and someone neither the US (with open criminal cases in Delaware) nor the EU could touch previously.
- Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies are required to be fully independent as an EU candidacy condition; he claims the resulting system is the most sophisticated in all of Europe.
- He argues the corruption narrative is partly Russian disinformation and partly a real problem in the US-side supply chain, not primarily Ukrainian governance.
- Of approximately $177 billion voted by the US, Ukraine received roughly half; he raises whether the gap constitutes corruption or lobbying within US contracting systems.
- A specific example: Ukraine was denied permission to use its own Antonov cargo aircraft for weapons transfers, forcing payment to US cargo companies for transport — reducing effective aid.
- Ukraine received mostly weapons, not money, making large-scale diversion logistically implausible while soldiers are fighting over weapon shortages at the front.
- He wants Trump and Musk to focus on the supply chain, not just Ukrainian governance, when investigating where aid goes.

## Elon Musk and Starlink

- Zelenskyy respects Musk as a self-made man whose results are tangible — contrasting him with Putin: "Musk launches rockets to save money; Putin launches rockets to kill people."
- Starlink was deployed both at the front lines and in schools and kindergartens after Russian strikes destroyed Ukraine's energy and internet infrastructure.
- As of January 2025, Musk had never visited Ukraine; Zelenskyy invited him and said he would like Musk "on our side as much as possible."

## Martial Law, Elections, and Democratic Legitimacy

- Elections were constitutionally prohibited during martial law — both the spring 2024 presidential election and the fall 2024 parliamentary election were suspended, not postponed by executive whim.
- An estimated 8.5 million Ukrainians are abroad; millions more live in occupied territories; a million soldiers are on active duty — making a fair election technically and logistically complex.
- His timeline: elections within 90 days of martial law ending, which requires a parliamentary vote; he believes the war could end in 2025.
- He has not decided whether to run for reelection and has not discussed it with his family; he is critical of politicians who are already campaigning during wartime as divisive.

## Ukraine's Postwar Economic Future

- Ukraine's Diia digital government platform — accessible via smartphone for all state services — is cited as the most advanced in Europe; African Union nations have requested it.
- He identifies oil and gas reserves in the Black Sea, gold reserves, and uranium reserves — the largest in Europe — as strategic assets for US investment partnerships.
- France urgently needs uranium after Russia pushed it out of African supply chains; Zelenskyy offers Ukraine as an alternative source and wants US companies to invest, not donate.
- The goal is to bring back the 8.5 million Ukrainians abroad with real jobs and economic opportunities, not cheap labor.
- Tax reform and deregulation are planned for after the war; during the war a military tax was introduced because partner funding did not cover soldiers' salaries for the 980,000-strong army.
- He frames Ukraine's alignment with Europe as a national cultural choice made by the people, irreversible, and the foundation of any postwar reconstruction.

# Javier Milei: President of Argentina - Freedom, Economics, and Corruption | Lex Fridman Podcast #453

A sitting president makes the case, with granular economic data, that the largest fiscal adjustment in human history is also a moral act — and that failing to fight the cultural battle dooms every economic victory.

## Intellectual Awakening: From Neoclassical to Austrian

- Milei's conversion to free-market economics began in 2013–2014 while studying the per-capita GDP "hockey stick" since 1800 and the simultaneous sevenfold population increase.
- A colleague recommended Murray Rothbard's essay "Monopoly and Competition," which caused Milei to conclude that 20 years of teaching microeconomics had been based on wrong premises.
- He then spent a Saturday calculating how much money he needed for his dogs' food and taxi fare — everything left over went on Austrian economics books.
- Reading Mises's *Human Action* in a single weekend he describes as "a true revolution in my head."
- The Austrian canon he consumed: Rothbard, Mises, Hayek, Hoppe, Huerta de Soto, Juan Ramón Rallo, Philipp Bagus, Walter Block, and Carl Menger's *Principles of Political Economy*.
- Before this period, the only Austrian text he had read was Garrison's *Money and Time*, which he now considers incomplete.

## Anarcho-Capitalism vs. Minarchism in Practice

- Milei calls himself "strictly speaking an anarcho-capitalist" whose ideal is the complete abolition of the state, grounded in the Benegas Lynch / Lockean non-aggression principle.
- In office he operates as a minarchist — minimizing state size wherever current institutional constraints allow.
- He rejects the "nirvana fallacy": comparing real-world policy to a perfect anarchist ideal and condemning any compromise as betrayal.
- His analogy: if you need to do an interview and the only table is rectangular, you sit at it — you don't refuse because you prefer round tables.
- He criticizes anarcho-capitalists who attack liberal reformers more harshly than they attack socialists, calling this behavior "functional to socialism."
- Murray Rothbard — who argued libertarians must enter politics or cede power to the left — is Milei's single greatest intellectual influence.

## The Crisis Milei Inherited

- In the first week of December 2023, Argentina's inflation was running at 1% per day — annualized to 3,700%.
- By the second half of December, wholesale inflation hit 54% monthly, equivalent to 17,000% annually.
- GDP per capita had fallen approximately 15% over the prior decade; nearly 50% of Argentinians lived in poverty.
- The fiscal deficit totalled 15% of GDP: 5 points in the Treasury, 10 points in the Central Bank through money printing.
- Interest-bearing Central Bank liabilities equalled four monetary bases maturing in a single day — enough to quintuple the money supply overnight.
- Peso-denominated maturities amounted to the equivalent of $90 billion; net foreign reserves were negative $12 billion; commercial debts at the Central Bank were $50 billion.

## The Reform Program

- Milei cut the number of ministries from roughly 18 to 9 (now 8) and dismissed approximately 50,000 civil servants.
- He eliminated discretionary transfers to provinces, halted public works, diluted public-sector wages, and removed energy subsidies by restoring utility rates (from 10% cost coverage to 80%).
- Argentina achieved fiscal balance in January 2024 — the first month of his administration — against a 113-year record of deficits in 123 years.
- He eliminated "poverty managers" — piquetero intermediaries who had been skimming up to half of welfare payments — doubling the effective transfer reaching recipients.
- The structural reform package (executive decree 70/23 plus the Bases Law) is eight times larger by scope than the Menem-era reforms previously considered the largest in Argentine history, passed with only 15% of representatives and 10% of senators.
- Deregulation Minister Federico Sturzenegger's office publicly displays a counter of days remaining on delegated powers; the ministry eliminates one to five economic restrictions every day, with 3,200 additional reforms still pending.

## Inflation and Economic Recovery

- Wholesale monthly inflation fell from 54% to 2% — a 27-fold reduction — moving annual inflation from a 17,000% trajectory to approximately 28%.
- Consumer inflation reached 2.7% monthly; subtracting a 2% crawling-peg devaluation and international inflation, Milei claims true monetary inflation is 0.2% per month, or roughly 2.4% annually.
- The Central Bank's balance sheet was cleaned of $45 billion in losses voluntarily, in six months, without price controls or exchange-rate pegging — distinguishing the program from every prior Argentine stabilization attempt.
- Poverty peaked at 57% in January 2024 after price controls were lifted and true prices became visible; by the time of the interview it had fallen to 46%, an 11-percentage-point reduction.
- De-seasonalized GDP data shows activity recovered to December 2023 levels by August 2024 — meaning the year will end with lower inflation, fewer poor, higher real wages, and a GDP above the starting point.
- JP Morgan revised Argentina growth projections upward to 5–6% for 2025; economist Juan Pablo Nicolini's Federal Reserve research projects the fiscal adjustment alone could sustain 7% annual GDP growth and double per capita GDP in ten years.
- Country risk fell from 3,000 basis points to 770; Fitch upgraded Argentina's rating to CCC.
- Milei jumped 90 places in economic freedom rankings, reaching institutional levels comparable to Germany, France, and Italy.

## Corruption and the Caste

- Before Milei, approximately 900 road blockades per year were conducted by piquetero groups, who received social-plan funding in exchange for political loyalty.
- After cutting their funding and enacting an anti-blockade protocol (blockaders lose welfare; lawbreakers go to jail), an expected 100,000-person march drew only 3,000 people, and street blockades effectively ceased.
- Kirchner-era corruption extended to disability pensions: one municipality had more disability pension recipients than total inhabitants.
- During Milei's government, former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was convicted of corruption; the day after sentencing, Milei revoked her privileged pension.
- Iran's involvement in two terrorist attacks on Argentine soil was also judicially condemned under Milei's government.
- Milei removed all official government advertising from media outlets; he argues most Argentine journalism — which he characterizes as operating an extortion-based business model — turned against him specifically because this cut their revenue.
- He sees social media, particularly X/Twitter, as having broken the media's monopoly on the microphone and therefore their leverage for extortion.

## The Three-Front War: Economics, Politics, Culture

- Milei frames the battle against socialism as requiring simultaneous victories on three fronts: economic policy, electoral politics, and cultural narrative.
- He argues that Chile's economic success eventually collapsed because liberals won on economics but ceded culture and education to the left, which then used those institutions to dismantle the market system.
- After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, socialism formally failed as an economic system; leftists then shifted class-struggle frameworks into gender, environment, race, and identity — what Milei calls "cultural Marxism."
- The São Paulo Forum, formed in 1990, implemented a Gramscian strategy to infiltrate media, education, and culture; Milei credits this with reshaping what counts as "politically correct" discourse.
- He identifies Fukuyama's "end of history" thesis as having made liberals complacent, allowing the left to advance culturally unchallenged through the 1990s and 2000s.
- "Market failures" as a concept, Milei argues in his book *Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap*, are mathematical artifacts of neoclassical modeling that do not exist in reality — but have been used to justify ever-expanding intervention, inevitably drifting toward socialism per Hayek's *Road to Serfdom*.

## Elon Musk and DOGE

- Milei's first meeting with Musk was scheduled for 50 minutes but ran 45 minutes before Musk nearly missed his flight; the conversation spontaneously turned to demographics and population growth.
- Musk asked Milei when he planned to have more children, then clarified "the four-legged ones don't count" — a reference to Milei's five cloned mastiff dogs.
- Milei describes Musk as having "unconventional intelligence," going far beyond typical business focus into cultural and demographic concerns he did not expect.
- Their most recent conversation lasted two and a half hours and focused on what was at stake for the United States in the 2024 election.
- Musk expressed strong interest in replicating Argentina's deregulation model through DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).
- Milei's advice to Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at DOGE: "Just cut to the chase — go all the way, push it to the very limit, and do not give up."
- He notes that those who complain about deregulation are people losing privileges, and they will be forced to publicly justify keeping those privileges — an uncomfortable position.

## Geopolitics and US-Argentina Relations

- Milei's campaign explicitly declared the United States and Israel as Argentina's only geopolitical allies, representing "the ideas of the western world" against autocrats.
- His three campaign pillars — fiscal austerity, security/anti-crime, and western alignment — were the top two public concerns when he took office; they have since dropped to fifth and sixth place as inflation and insecurity fell.
- He wants Argentina to join NATO.
- On dollarization: Milei clarifies he advocates "currency competition" rather than strict dollarization — eliminating the Central Bank so citizens can transact in any currency, with the peso naturally declining in share as dollar usage grows.
- He considered a bond-based dollarization plan (buying Central Bank bonds at 20 cents on the dollar; they now trade at 60–70 cents) but was blocked; he says that attempt would have landed him in jail given the opposition.
- Ireland's trajectory — from Europe's poorest country 40 years ago to a GDP per capita 50% above the United States — is his reference case for what sustained economic freedom produces.

## Faith, Identity, and Personal Philosophy

- Milei has been studying Torah and Jewish teachings intensively in recent years, which he credits as providing a framework to endure the adversity of political life.
- His greatest historical hero is Moses: "one person alone with his brother Aaron confronting the combined forces of the United States, China, and Russia."
- He describes certain moments of human achievement — Maradona's 1986 dribble against England, Puccini arias, Messi's movement — as instances where humans "vibrate closer to God."
- When asked whether the invisible hand of the market or the hand of God is the better guide, he answers: "They're perfectly in sync."
- His catchphrase "Viva la libertad, carajo" originated at book presentations and is now the closing line of every speech, preceded by references to Maccabees 3:19: "Victory in battle doesn't depend on the size of the army, but on the forces of heaven."
- He was a goalkeeper in his youth, which he says gave him the temperament to make decisions alone under conditions where a single mistake has disproportionate consequences for millions.

## Character, Resilience, and Advice

- Milei's nickname "El Loco" (the madman) has followed him since age 10; he embraces it, noting that San Martín, Michelangelo, and Einstein were all called crazy before succeeding.
- He relates strongly to Trump's experience of sustained, coordinated media attack; Argentine journalists sent three drones to spy on his presidential residence.
- His father was hospitalized and nearly died of a heart attack during a period when journalists were spreading lies about the family.
- He rates Sylvester Stallone's Rocky philosophy — keep going no matter how hard you're hit — as directly applicable to his own presidency.
- On loyalty: he considers it his defining trait (his Hebrew name means "loyal friend") and says he does not forgive those who have betrayed or defamed him, admitting dogs surpass him morally in unconditional love.
- Advice to young people: define what makes you happy and live consistently by it; never be half-hearted; prefer to fail by trying than to be safe by never attempting.

# Adam Frank: Alien Civilizations and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | Lex Fridman Podcast #455

## Planet Formation and the Universality of Worlds

- Planet formation begins with interstellar gas clouds containing up to a million solar masses; turbulence causes local collapse into a proto-star surrounded by a rotating accretion disc from which planets coalesce via dust grains, pebbles, rocks, and boulders over millions of years.
- Early theories in the 20th century suggested planets form when two stars pass close enough to gravitationally squeeze out material — a process so rare it would predict roughly one in a trillion stars would have planets; instead, every star in the night sky hosts a family of worlds.
- Earth's Moon formed when a Mars-sized body slammed into early Earth and blew off enough material to eventually coalesce into the Moon.
- The Snow Line — located between Mars and Jupiter in our solar system — marks where temperatures drop low enough for water ice to condense, explaining why Jupiter and Saturn's moons contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.
- The most common type of planet in the universe — Super-Earths with masses between one and ten times Earth's — does not exist in our solar system, making the solar system statistically anomalous.
- At the University of Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics, Frank's collaboration uses giant lasers to slam tiny silica samples to simulate pressures at the centers of Super-Earths — conditions reaching tens of millions of times the surface pressure of Earth.

## Plate Tectonics, the Boring Billion, and the Cambrian Explosion

- Plate tectonics may be critical for complex life because without it, a planet can enter a permanent snowball state — once fully iced over, a planet can stay frozen forever, leaving any life trapped at the microbial stage.
- Volcanic activity driven by plate tectonics pumps CO2 into the atmosphere, which warms a snowball planet and can trigger escape from glaciation; Earth used this mechanism to exit at least two full snowball phases.
- Early Earth had a more mild form of plate tectonics, but around one billion years ago it ramped up significantly, triggering the formation of Himalayan-scale mountain ranges for the first time.
- Mountain weathering and erosion following the ramp-up of plate tectonics flooded the oceans with nutrients, causing net primary productivity — the rate of photosynthesis at the base of the food chain — to jump by a factor of nearly 1,000.
- Life originated on Earth at least 3.8 billion years ago, but for roughly a billion years afterward — called the Boring Billion — only microbes existed and nothing of apparent evolutionary complexity occurred.
- The Cambrian Explosion, where nearly every animal body plan appeared in a geologically brief window, coincides with the period when continents were slamming together and creating new evolutionary niches through large-scale planetary turmoil.

## The Hard Steps Model and the Co-Evolution of Life and Planet

- The Hard Steps Model, introduced by physicist Brandon Carter, argues that a handful of extremely improbable evolutionary transitions are required for intelligence, and that their rarity makes technological civilizations vanishingly uncommon.
- Carter's model assumes the planet and the biosphere evolve independently — an assumption rejected by virtually every biogeophysicist, who regard the co-evolution of life and planet as foundational; the model's conclusions change dramatically once this coupling is included.
- Carter inferred that intelligence arriving near the end of a star's lifetime implies low probability, but this ignores that Earth's timescale for complex evolution is set by stellar physics — the same stellar lifetime governs both the planet's habitability window and evolution's clock.
- Several apparent "hard steps" — evolutionary innovations that only occurred once — may reflect information loss in the fossil record or the "pulling up the ladder" effect: a successful lineage fills the niche so completely that no competitor can repeat the innovation.
- Wings have evolved independently many times across unrelated lineages (insects, dinosaurs, bats), demonstrating that some apparent hard steps are actually not hard at all — just physically constrained solutions to common problems.
- Adam Frank's recent paper found that none of the candidate hard steps survived scrutiny once planetary-biological co-evolution was accounted for, shifting the burden of argument significantly toward those who claim technological intelligence is rare.

## The Drake Equation and the Pessimism Line

- Frank Drake devised his equation in 1960 the night before a small meeting on interstellar communication — not as a law of nature but as an agenda, breaking the question of civilizations into seven sub-problems to give researchers a research roadmap.
- The seven terms of the Drake equation are: stellar formation rate, fraction of stars with planets, number of habitable-zone planets per star, fraction where life forms, fraction where intelligence evolves, fraction where technology emerges, and average civilization lifetime.
- Exoplanet science has nailed the first two astronomical terms: essentially every star has planets (F_p ≈ 1), and roughly one in five stars has an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone (N_e ≈ 0.2).
- In a 2016 paper with Woodruff Sullivan, Frank reframed the Drake equation to eliminate the unknown lifetime term by asking instead: what is the probability that technological civilization has occurred anywhere in the observable universe at any point in cosmic history?
- The observable universe contains approximately 10 billion trillion (10²²) habitable-zone planets — meaning 10 billion trillion independent experiments in abiogenesis and evolution have been conducted.
- The "Pessimism Line" from the Sullivan-Frank paper states: if the probability per habitable-zone planet of producing a technological civilization is less than one in 10²², we are alone; if it is any larger, then civilization has happened elsewhere in cosmic history — placing the burden of proof on pessimists.
- Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 in part for advocating that other worlds might harbor life; the Pessimism Line is the first quantitative constraint that makes such pessimism testable.

## The Fermi Paradox and the Silurian Hypothesis

- The Fermi paradox originated in 1950 when Enrico Fermi, walking to lunch at Los Alamos, calculated that even at sub-light speeds a civilization could hop across the galaxy in a few hundred thousand years, then asked: "Where is everybody?"
- The indirect Fermi paradox — the argument that decades of SETI silence proves aliens don't exist — is statistically empty: Jason Wright's team found that all SETI searches ever conducted combined cover no more than a "hot tub's worth" of an ocean's worth of the total search space.
- Frank's group simulated interstellar colonization with agent-based modeling and confirmed that expansion waves can cross the galaxy quickly, but when civilizations are given finite lifetimes, large sterile bubbles open up in the galaxy that can persist for millions of years.
- A paper by Frank and Gavin Schmidt — named the Silurian Hypothesis after a Doctor Who episode — demonstrated that an industrial civilization lasting 10,000 years and then vanishing would leave no detectable trace in Earth's geological record after 100 million years.
- The fossil record is too sparse and most materials do not fossilize; even large cities would be undetectable after 100 million years, meaning past civilizations on Earth or ancient alien visitors cannot be ruled out on geological grounds alone.
- The only possible way to detect a prior industrial civilization in Earth's history would be through unusual isotopic signatures in geological strata analogous to those humanity is currently creating — a search that has not yet been systematically conducted.

## Biosignatures and Technosignatures

- Frank is principal investigator on the first NASA grant ever awarded specifically to develop exoplanet technosignatures — NASA had for years been reluctant to fund research explicitly connected to intelligent extraterrestrial life.
- A biosignature is any spectral feature in a planetary atmosphere that cannot be explained by geochemistry alone; oxygen and methane together are a strong biosignature because they react away on geological timescales and would disappear within millions of years without continuous biological replenishment.
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the strongest technosignature candidate because no known natural process produces them — detecting their spectral fingerprint in an exoplanet atmosphere would constitute unambiguous evidence of industrial chemistry.
- Sophia Sheikh's "Earth from Earth" study found that Earth's radio emissions remain the most detectable technosignature at interstellar distances using current technology; city lights and CFC concentrations become detectable only from within the solar system.
- The James Webb Space Telescope detected methane in the atmosphere of K2-18b — a potential "hycean world" with a hydrogen atmosphere over a deep liquid water ocean, located 120 light years away — at five-sigma confidence, the gold standard of scientific detection.
- Frank's team is building the first-ever library of technosignatures, cataloguing all physically plausible technological activities (solar-panel glint, artificial city lighting, CFC emissions, propulsion plumes) and ranking them by detectability at interstellar distances.
- An "agnostic biosignature" uses information theory rather than specific chemistry: any atmosphere wildly out of thermodynamic equilibrium — quantified via Gibbs free energy — indicates a non-geological process pumping molecules faster than they react away, whether biological or technological.

## Megastructures, the Kardashev Scale, and Detection

- A Dyson sphere — proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960 simultaneously with Kardashev's scale — would capture all photons from a star; a rigid sphere is physically unstable, but a Dyson swarm of millions of orbiting collectors is theoretically stable and would radiate waste heat in the infrared.
- Jason Wright's group at Penn State searched for Dyson swarm candidates using infrared excess and identified a handful of anomalous stars that could not be classified as definite non-detections — not claimed detections, but "not non-detections."
- Tabby's Star (KIC 8462852) showed irregular, non-periodic transit dips inconsistent with any known planetary configuration; the candidate list in the discovery paper included alien megastructures, though follow-up observations pointed to dust clouds as the most likely explanation.
- A "Clarke Belt" — a densely occupied geosynchronous orbit analogous to the ring of satellites Earth is beginning to build — could in principle produce a detectable transit signal if dense enough, representing a planetary-scale megastructure observable remotely.
- The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations by energy use: Type I uses all stellar energy incident on a planet (~10¹⁶ watts), Type II uses all energy from the star itself (~10²⁶ watts), Type III uses galactic energy (~10³⁶ watts); humanity currently sits at approximately 0.7 on this logarithmic scale.
- Projections suggest humanity will reach Kardashev Type I around the year 2300 if energy use continues on its current trajectory, but the second law of thermodynamics means using that much energy on Earth's surface would devastate the biosphere through waste heat.
- Frank proposes "service worlds" as a long-term solution: moving heavy industry to places like Mercury where there is no biosphere to disrupt, harvesting stellar energy off-world, and sending it back — making expansion into the solar system inseparable from solving Earth's climate crisis.

## UFOs, UAPs, and Scientific Standards of Evidence

- Frank supports an open, transparent, scientific investigation of UFOs and UAPs but states clearly that none of the existing claimed evidence meets the standards of evidence required to link any sighting to non-human technology.
- Scientific standards of evidence were developed over 400 years and are why cell phones work: without rigorous causal attribution, every antenna design would be unreliable — the same rigor applied to UFO claims yields no positive detections.
- A rational detection infrastructure for UAPs would require upward-looking ground-based detectors (like meteor networks), space-based detectors on satellites, and alert systems on aircraft — but crucially all instruments must be fully characterized across all wavelengths and processing steps before any claim can be made.
- After writing a New York Times op-ed on UAPs in 2021, Frank reviewed discussions in the signals-intelligence community and found that specialists almost universally interpreted reported incidents as peer-state adversary activity involving drone technology and deliberate radar spoofing.
- The "high beam argument": an advanced civilization capable of crossing interstellar distances but supposedly wishing to remain hidden would not repeatedly be spotted and then disappear — the pattern of UAP reports is inconsistent with a civilization that actually possesses superior stealth technology.

## The Physics of Life, the Blind Spot, and Experience

- Frank argues that the most important open question in all of science is not cosmology or quantum gravity but "what is life?" — specifically, what distinguishes a rock from a cell in physical terms, which he frames as the problem of agency and autonomous action.
- In the book "The Blind Spot" (co-authored with Evan Thompson and Marcelo Gleiser), Frank argues that science has a structural blind spot: it can only proceed by stripping experience out of its models, but then falsely treats the resulting abstraction as more real than the experience it came from.
- The "parable of temperature" illustrates the blind spot: the concept of degrees Celsius emerged from the bodily experience of hot and cold through communal measurement; modern science then treats 60°F as more real than the felt sense of warmth — an inversion called the "amnesia of experience."
- The blind spot produces three pathological cultural responses: scientific triumphalism (only what can be formalized is real), postmodern rejection of science (it's just a power game), and pseudoscience (elevating experience in spiritually confused ways) — each response feeds the others.
- QBism (Quantum Bayesianism), developed by Chris Fuchs and collaborators, places the Born rule — the act of measurement by an agent — at the center of quantum mechanics rather than treating it as an awkward appendix to the Schrödinger equation, and Frank sees this as a model for how all of science might reintegrate the agent.
- Semantic information — information that helps an organism survive, as opposed to Shannon's purely probabilistic measure — provides a rigorous framework for studying how bacteria navigate chemical gradients, how cells make decisions, and ultimately what it means for a physical system to "care" about its environment.
- Adam Frank has practiced Zen contemplative meditation for 30 years and credits the practice with giving him a direct, experiential understanding of what the Blind Spot describes philosophically — the constructed nature of the self and the primacy of moment-to-moment experience over abstract identity.

# Oliver Anthony: Country Music, Blue-Collar America, Fame, Money, and Pain | Lex Fridman Podcast #469

A singer-songwriter who went from open-mic embarrassments and factory floors to a number-one viral hit explains why he walked away from $8 million in record deals to stay true to the people whose pain he gave voice to.

## Origins in Open Mics and Early Music

- Oliver Anthony's stage name is borrowed from his grandfather, born in 1930s Appalachia — "dirt floors, seven kids, hard times."
- His early open-mic sets at smoky rural Virginia bars were plagued by panic attacks; on one occasion he walked off mid-song, packed his guitar, and left without finishing.
- He never drank at bars where he performed — he was there purely to play, which made him feel out of place from the start.
- He covered artists like Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Hank Jr., and David Allan Coe — songs designed to get audiences singing along.
- Mandolin player Johnny Staats of West Virginia exemplified the ideal: award-winning musicianship, still works full-time for UPS, plays for joy rather than fame.

## The Corporate Machine and the Death of Soul in Music

- Commercialized country radio no longer reflects the music Oliver grew up with; many fans of traditional country have quietly stopped listening.
- Applying "corporate America tactics" to art inevitably strips out its humanity — the machine over-polishes songs until nothing authentic remains.
- Workers in corporate environments suppress personal expression out of fear of job loss — becoming robots for 8–10 hours a day to preserve a paycheck.
- "Quiet quitting" — showing up physically but emotionally absent — slowly destroys companies from within and demoralizes the people who actually do the work.
- Oliver draws a parallel between Boeing's bureaucratic dysfunction and SpaceX's speed: managerial layers, endless meetings between "Bob, John, and Debbie," kill the passion of engineers on the ground.

## Writing Rich Men North of Richmond

- "Rich Men North of Richmond" began as a 30-second phone recording in July 2023 — just a chorus fragment: "I would sell my soul for bullshit pay."
- Draven Riffe of Radio WV spotted the unfinished clip on TikTok and told Oliver, "We got to record that one" — Oliver's response: "Dude, that's all I got."
- Oliver's songwriting process is entirely oral — he records himself on his phone repeatedly over weeks or months rather than writing lyrics down.
- The audio ripped from those phone videos — converted via a "sketchy MP3 to WAV site" — became the actual files uploaded to Spotify.
- "I've Got to Get Sober" was written during his period of quitting drinking; the cicada sounds bleeding into the recording felt to him like a divine sign.
- Songs arrive like waking dreams: vivid and complete for a moment, then gone forever if not captured immediately — usually just the first half of a verse or a chorus line.
- He deliberately avoids co-writing rooms ("sit on the couch, smoke a joint, write a song") because forced writing produces truck-beer-girl songs he refuses to make.

## Viral Fame, Integrity, and Turning Down $8 Million

- "Rich Men North of Richmond" was posted August 8, 2023; it went straight to number one on multiple charts and generated tens of millions of plays within days.
- Nine days later Oliver posted that he had received 50,000-plus messages — stories of suicide, addiction, unemployment, depression, and hopelessness.
- He turned down record deals described publicly as worth $8 million, telling the industry he did not want "six tour buses, 15 tractor trailers, and a jet."
- His reasoning: the audience put the song there, not a machine — signing away would be a betrayal of the people who gave him that platform.
- At shows he closes with: "No matter how they make you feel online, there will always be more of us than them" — and he watches the light return to people's eyes when he says it.
- He fears being co-opted by political factions: "Rich Men North of Richmond" resonated with people who voted differently from each other, which he found "almost alarming" given his intent.

## Blue-Collar America and the Invisible Working Class

- For eight years Oliver worked in industrial sales, visiting construction sites and speaking with 20 different blue-collar workers a day — that immersion informed the song.
- He started his first job at 18 at Perfect Air, a commercial air-conditioning factory in Marion, NC, alongside convicted felons and high-school dropouts — the place has since closed.
- People who do underwater welding, underground pipework, or high-elevation construction are invisible in public culture while "dimwitted celebrities" are idolized.
- His friend Jaco (a different Jaco from Jocko) works 70–80 hours a week on the Chesapeake Bay Tunnel project — no one knows his story.
- A man at a Lowe's near Oliver's property, trying to sell land to fund his 19-year-old son's heart surgery, represents the "insanely complex life" hidden behind an ordinary job title.
- Skilled trades — plumbing, electrical, agriculture, welding — are dying because they are no longer culturally celebrated; Oliver sees media attention as the fix.
- Blue-collar workers have among the highest suicide rates of any occupational group; Oliver connects this directly to the silence, isolation, and economic precarity of that life.
- Kierkegaard's maxim "the crowd is un-truth" (cited via a Jordan Peterson conversation) applies literally to his shows: he tries to perform to individuals inside the crowd, not to the crowd as a mass.

## Depression, Drinking, and the Road to Recovery

- Oliver dropped out of high school at 17, effectively ran away from home, had his first child at 18 or 19 while working a factory job, and never had a plan.
- His definition of depression: when everything you love becomes meaningless and you can't find excitement or purpose in anything.
- The mechanism he describes for male suicide: months of negative self-reflection accumulate into a mountain of neglected responsibilities; death appears to be an easier detour than climbing back out.
- Men mask suicidal ideation better than women — friends he has lost to suicide often showed no visible warning signs beforehand.
- He stopped drinking shortly before "Rich Men North of Richmond" went viral; sobriety allowed him to be honest with himself for the first time in years.
- Andrew Huberman's observation about medication adherence resonated: people are far more likely to keep their dog on a pill schedule than themselves — because they don't see their dog's faults the way they see their own.
- Faith was central to his recovery: reading the New Testament and the idea of being loved despite being "wretched" gave him a framework external to self-worth.
- His rule of thumb for anyone at rock bottom: go find somewhere in nature and just sit in it.

## Nature, Farming, and the Permaculture Vision

- In 2019 Oliver sold his modest house, bought 92 acres at roughly $1,100/acre (financed), and moved his family into a $750 camper while building a life from scratch.
- The property is a mile off the road; he had to recut an old logging road with a Kubota tractor on 0% financing.
- He describes that move as "when I really started to live" and "the beginning point of the restoration of me."
- He now raises laying hens, meat birds, pigs, sheep, and goats; cattle (Wagyu and Angus) are planned for the next season.
- His purchased permaculture farm — dormant six or seven years, with an orchard and blueberry fields — is intended as a healing center, combining animals, food production, and optimal sensory conditions for mental health recovery.
- Robert Kennedy Jr. visited the property; they discussed launching a formal healing center there once the political work allows bandwidth.
- Nature's structured systems — soil microbes, bacteria, plants, trees, birds — restore his sense that something bigger than human disorder exists and is in charge.

## Technology, Social Media, and the Dopamine Trap

- Social media algorithms emulate human needs (connection, recognition, stimulation) without delivering the long-term fulfillment those needs actually require.
- Oliver describes the current moment as a "breath of time" — the last window when people still have memory of pre-digital life and can consciously choose to balance the two.
- He believes the window is closing fast: if society doesn't act now, future generations will have no experiential reference for what they are missing.
- Technology improves "at lightning speed" while cities fall apart, social trust decays, and mental health worsens — the two curves are diverging.
- Doom-scrolling is not a personal failing but a deliberate engineering outcome: enormous psychology and research goes into making algorithms as addictive as possible.
- No argument with his wife has ever been resolved over text; disputes require in-person presence, which is his proxy for the general rule that real healing requires physical proximity.
- His prescription for fixing the problem: identify what people watch obsessively online (wood-splitting, blacksmithing, farming) and create real-life versions of those experiences to immerse people in.

## Politics, Power, and "Rich Men North of Richmond"

- Oliver insists he is not a political person, but acknowledges the song landed in a politically charged moment; he sees people arguing about symptoms rather than underlying problems.
- Both the left ("the elites exploit the working class") and the right ("the deep state betrays middle America") articulate the same core grievance in different vocabulary.
- His read on Trump and Biden: both are ultimately "rich men north of Richmond" — people in power who, regardless of intent, serve those close to them and lose sight of the working class.
- He extends the logic to all power structures: the power of elites exists only because the majority allows it "willingly or through negligence" — "there will always be more of us than them."
- He critiques political tribalism as algorithm-driven: people choose news sources that never challenge them, producing a cult-like filter bubble.
- Theatrical politeness is the danger signal: the Soviet Union was outwardly civil while atrocities happened underneath; he quotes Tom Waits — "I like my town with a little drop of poison."

## The Guitar, the Sound, and Playing Live in 2025

- Oliver's original instrument was a $300–$400 entry-level Gretsch resonator bought by his wife on Amazon; its pickup was faulty, requiring a suction-cup microphone rig to play amplified shows up to 10,000 people.
- Paul Beard of Beard Guitars (a small family operation in Maryland) reached out, repaired the Gretsch, and hand-built the custom resonator Oliver now uses.
- The resonator is tuned a full step down — giving it the dull, slightly out-of-tune quality of old Appalachian recordings, which is intentional.
- "Oliver Anthony Music" is meant to evoke 1930s Virginia folk and bluegrass; his family is from roughly 20 miles from where the Carter Family originated.
- His 2024 tour offered $25 ticket options, which industry professionals mocked — but working-class families in hand-me-down clothes thanked him personally for making attendance possible.
- His 2025 vision: bypass Ticketmaster and Live Nation by establishing shows in farm fields 45 minutes outside major cities, with non-profit venue structures owned by towns or farms.
- The goal is 20 such permanent venues per year — spaces that "can't be perverted by corporate America," each becoming a community anchor for music and gathering.
- He has not played his catalog since September 2024; performing dark material like "I've Got to Get Sober" requires fully feeling it, which Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons) calls the performer's duty to the audience — and it takes a toll every time.

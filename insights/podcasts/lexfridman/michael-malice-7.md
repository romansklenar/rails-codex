# Michael Malice: Thanksgiving Pirate Special | Lex Fridman Podcast #402

A freewheeling Thanksgiving conversation in which Malice's consistent aesthetic — seeking beauty in "God's mistakes," dark humor, and contrarian takes — holds together an otherwise sprawling tour through comedy, art collecting, geopolitics, and personal vulnerability.

## Exotic Animals and "God's Mistakes"

- Malice describes the peacock mantis shrimp as his favorite animal: eight legs, six arms, two punching or spearing claws depending on genus, and a punch as powerful as a bullet.
- The spearing variety is called "thumb splitters" by divers because contact can cut a thumb to the bone.
- Mantis shrimp have the best eyesight of any animal, seeing in seven distinct ways; making eye contact with one is, per Malice, genuinely terrifying.
- Malice kept a peacock mantis shrimp as a pet until it died from a failed molt caused by wrong minerals in the tank; he still keeps a pair of its shed punching appendages.
- He prefers deep-ocean creatures over space exploration: "space is dead," whereas ocean life is alive and strange.
- He references OctoNation (octonation.com) as the authoritative source for cephalopod information.
- Some squids have asymmetric eyes — one large, one small — because they swim horizontally with one eye facing up toward light and one down.

## Humor, Dark Comedy, and Comedic Taste

- Malice finds Monty Python entirely unfunny, and had the same experience with The Big Lebowski after years of cultural overexposure made appreciation impossible.
- He cites Joan Rivers quoting Winston Churchill: "When you make people laugh, you're giving them a little vacation."
- His favorite comedian of all time is Neil Hamburger, the character played by Gregg Turkington — a deliberately unfunny act that rewards audiences who understand the meta-joke.
- Malice's litmus-test joke structure: Norm Macdonald's "giant pumpkin head" joke separates audiences into those who find anti-comedy funny and those who stare blankly.
- The funniest talk-show clip Malice has seen is Norm Macdonald on Conan with Courtney Thorne-Smith and Carrot Top, where Norm ad-libs "Chairman of the Board" is spelled "B-O-R-E-D."
- Norm Macdonald's appeal: he feels like a member of the audience rather than a performer, as though he's winking at the crowd and asking "can you believe I'm doing this?"
- Roseanne Barr got Norm Macdonald his first job; Malice describes her as "pathologically funny" and says making her laugh feels like performing a mitzvah.
- Malice argues marginalized groups (African Americans, Jewish Americans, gay Americans) are disproportionately represented in comedy because outsider status grants a different perspective and nothing left to lose.
- North Koreans, despite total repression, have strong senses of humor — Malice says this made it harder to leave after his 2012 visit because "nothing is more human than laughter and laughter's free."

## Thanksgiving Gratitude

- Malice's top gratitude: his six-year-old nephew Lucas, who pranked his own grandmother by calling her pretending Malice was hospitalized, then said "Prank."
- Malice brought Lucas to a Dinesh D'Souza film premiere at Mar-a-Lago; when told they were visiting a former president, Lucas asked "Abe Lincoln?"
- Second gratitude: his creative career — being able to write what he wants and have a large enough audience to cover his living, without needing a boss.
- He defines "making it" as not having a boss, and his personal proof was acquiring Margaret Thatcher's bookcases as an immigrant.
- He is producing a graphic novel based on a screenplay he wrote over 20 years ago about the 1980s band Rubber Rodeo, facilitated by connection with Harvey Pekar (who wrote the 2006 graphic novel *Ego and Hubris* about Malice).
- Gratitude for social media: it enables niche connections, permanent contact with people otherwise lost, and tools like Twitter's Community Notes to expose institutional dishonesty.
- His move from New York to Austin resolved a loneliness problem — New York had become isolating as places and people disappeared; Austin provides a long list of old friends available on short notice.

## Human Nature and the Veneer of Civilization

- Malice's position: humans are "basically animals" and "fundamentally deranged" with only a thin veneer of civilization.
- The Holocaust illustrates how fast the veneer strips away: people do things within five years that would have been "completely unthinkable even to themselves."
- Lex pushes back: humans are capable of profound goodness and recent history shows communal good outweighing communal harm.
- Malice concedes humans are capable of "such profound goodness that it makes you extremely emotional," but calls it unusual rather than the norm.
- The sketch show *I Think You Should Leave* captures this dynamic: thin normalcy punctuated by the craziness lurking beneath.
- The show *Hoarders* follows the same narrative structure in every episode: veneer of normalcy, veneer of normalcy, slight concern, full-blown derangement.
- Malice distinguishes nature as not inherently violent — animals coexist and ignore each other most of the time; predator-prey is a minority interaction.

## Antisemitism and Bigotry

- Malice argues antisemitism is categorically different from other prejudices because it openly advocates for killing, not merely discrimination.
- The antisemitic moral calculus: Jews are the only group capable of good or evil, and they are exclusively attributed evil; non-Jewish bad actors are merely "Jew-controlled."
- Example: the George W. Bush White House had many non-Jewish neoconservatives (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Rice), yet blame for the Iraq War lands solely on Jewish advisors in this worldview.
- He criticizes framing George Soros as a Holocaust survivor to immunize him from political criticism, calling the equation with Anne Frank "disingenuous and repulsive."
- Best strategy against any bigotry: the "ambassador program" — personal acquaintance with a group member collapses the out-group abstraction; the mechanism that shifted American attitudes toward gay people.
- He cites the shift from universal hatred of gay Americans in the 1980s (people dying of AIDS without telling their parents) to Times Square covered in pride flags as proof the ambassador model works.

## Geopolitics: Brave New World vs. 1984

- Malice rejects Mearsheimer's offensive realism: the world is closer to *Brave New World* than to *1984* — control operates through soft power, not military threat.
- China's influence on America runs through university infiltration, TikTok, and cultural penetration — not military intimidation.
- American hegemony is primarily a function of cultural export (music, TV, movies), not military bases; Swedish indie pop performed in English is an example of this pull.
- Malice cites COVID as a *Brave New World* case: the population largely complied through persuasion, not just coercion, and many are "begging for it to come back."
- He prefers this framing because soft power is cheaper, more durable, and more dangerous than overt force.

## Karl Marx, Religion, and Activist Atheism

- Malice rejects Marx's "religion is the opium of the people" quote as misapplied to the present — he can identify people who found faith and became "objectively better human beings."
- He defends the historical context of Marx's claim: 19th-century workers were being told to endure starvation now for heavenly reward later, which was a specific political bargain.
- He compares sneering at religious belief to sneering at recovering alcoholics who use the disease model — if the framing keeps someone sober and moral, the intellectual objection is worthless.
- A college classmate told Malice at 17: "There's nothing you're going to tell me that's going to make me lose my faith" — Malice now recognizes that as self-aware and profound.
- Activist atheism is "midwit" behavior: proving someone else is wrong does not make you right; you can both be stupid.

## Art Collecting and the Contemporary Art Scene

- The mystery box contains a sculpture called *Chance Murmur* by Turkey-based sculptor Jake Michael Singer, made as a gift after Singer followed Malice on Instagram and wanted his work in spaces he admires.
- Singer's work synthesizes Nike (Goddess of Victory), Italian Futurism (capturing motion in 3D form), and angelic imagery.
- Malice's practice: buy yourself something to mark real achievements so that during hard times you can look at it and remember.
- He owns Margaret Thatcher's bookcases, an original Patrick Nagel painting (a rare male subject — Nagel predominantly drew women, including the Duran Duran Rio cover), and an ancient Egyptian ibis mummy purchased at auction, still in bandages, overlooking his desk.
- Thoth, the Egyptian god with an ibis head, invented writing and is the god of knowledge and the moon — Malice bought the statue to honor his writing career; the mummy arrived a week later.
- He bought 15 trilobite fossils off eBay after going down that rabbit hole; eBay lists them as "used" because its system only supports "new or used."
- Contemporary art galleries Malice recommends: Outre Gallery, Antler Gallery, Giant Robot 2, Spoke Art, Corey Helford (LA), Night Gallery, Vertical Gallery, Avant Gallery, Hive Gallery, Haven Gallery, Curio Art Gallery.
- His argument: most contemporary gallery work is accessible in price, immediately comprehensible, and made by young artists trying to add beauty — conservatives who dismiss all contemporary art as garbage are wrong.

## Books, Writing, and Interviewing

- Malice's hero is Albert Camus but he finds Camus's novels pointless — *The Plague* can be summarized in a sentence and the novel adds nothing.
- He disputes this for *Animal Farm*, which he considers a methodical narrative of transformation, not reducible to a synopsis.
- Favorite historians: Arthur Herman, Victor Sebesten, David Pietrusza, Ron Chernow (Hamilton biography), and Anne Applebaum for Soviet history — though he notes she is accused of being a neocon warmonger in contemporary contexts.
- He used Serhii Plokhy as a source for *The White Pill*; Lex praises Plokhy for combining rigor and emotional clarity without ideological distortion despite being Ukrainian.
- His interviewing principle: ask questions the subject has never been asked, especially when the person is known for one specific thing.
- He argues people love to feel "seen" — even the best guinea pig breeder in America has a story worth pursuing; the right response to unusual passion is "sit down and tell me everything."
- He self-identifies as "anarchist without adjectives" — he respects all strains including left anarchism and Emma Goldman, while believing hierarchies inevitably emerge in any group.

## The Wet Shaving Obsession

- Malice has assembled a rotation of exactly 67 artisanal wet shaving soaps — brush, soap canister, lather, then shave.
- He tested several hundred soaps across dimensions of scent, lather thickness, and shave quality to arrive at the 67.
- He maintains 86 candidates in a queue; when a soap slot opens, he auditions candidates until a new one earns a spot.
- Top recommended companies: Aion Skincare (formerly Grooming Department, renamed due to cultural connotations), Barrister and Mann (recommended scent: Cheshire), Chiseled Face (Midnight Stag smells "like a garage"), Phoenix Shaving (Aloha Smackdown smells like Hawaiian Punch; they made him a custom Yule Ham scent), Catie's Bubbles (vegan, New Jersey, Knee High to a Grape smells like grape soda).
- He was introduced to wet shaving by friend Cole Stryker while staying at Cole's house before a Rogan appearance — Stryker introduced him to Proraso ("the Italian grandpa soap").
- Lex observes: you can measure your remaining life in soaps — each shave is a small beautiful experience.

## Happiness, Depression, Fear, and Betrayal

- Malice's happiness advice: replace "I have to be a great writer" with "I can be a better writer" — measurable incremental improvement over unattainable standards.
- For men specifically: having a chart where data shows you're improving produces immediate sense of accomplishment.
- He reframes fear of mistakes: everyone important gets "hit in the face"; the goal is to become strong enough to absorb it.
- His distinction on depression: low points tied to real bad circumstances make sense; depression in the absence of bad circumstances is "by definition irrational."
- He is more anxious than depressed; primary fear is increasing authoritarianism, which he sees as more imminent in Canada than the US.
- He is not afraid of death: "if I died tomorrow, I did pretty good with what I had; I've saved a couple of lives."
- On betrayal: he has been betrayed and chooses not to let it color future trust — he feels bad for the betrayer because "you know you're not a good person" when you betray someone who trusted you.
- He distinguishes sympathy (wishing someone well) from empathy (putting yourself in their shoes); he can sympathize with betrayers but cannot empathize because his own strong guilt response makes the action incomprehensible.
- Closing sentiment: Malice identifies with the *American Beauty* plastic-bag scene — seeing beauty where others see garbage — and prefers that orientation to cynicism.

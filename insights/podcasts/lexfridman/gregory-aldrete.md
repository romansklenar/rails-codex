# Gregory Aldrete: The Roman Empire - Rise and Fall of Ancient Rome | Lex Fridman Podcast #443

A historian who specializes in practical reconstruction — of armor, of gestures, of daily life — uses Rome to show that the most important forces in history are often the mundane ones: manpower, diet, inheritance customs, and the weight of ancestors.

## Ancient World vs. Modern World

- Child mortality in the ancient world ran 30–40% before puberty; this shaped psychology and daily life more profoundly than any political system.
- Roughly 90% of people in the Roman Empire were subsistence family farmers who never traveled more than 20 miles from their village and never witnessed a battle, a work of art, or a philosopher.
- Human nature — fear, greed, love, ambition — is roughly constant across 2,000 years; tombstones, graffiti, and financial scraps on parchment produce moments of recognition across millennia.
- The single biggest psychological difference between ancient and modern people is the relationship to the past: Romans were obsessed with ancestors in a way that was both inspiring and oppressive.
- The Latin phrase *mos maiorum* ("the way of the ancestors") functioned as the Roman word for tradition and was treated as a binding obligation, not a suggestion.
- Roman aristocrats kept wax death masks of all ancestors in a cabinet by the front door; children memorized every office held and every battle fought by each ancestor.
- At funerals, family members literally wore the ancestor's wax mask in the funeral procession — the individual was understood as the current iteration of a family lineage, not an autonomous self.
- Marcus Junius Brutus was pressured to assassinate Julius Caesar — his best friend — by anonymous graffiti citing what his ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus had done 500 years earlier when Rome expelled its kings.

## Three Phases of Roman History

- Roman history divides into three phases: the Monarchy (753–509 BC), the Republic (509–27 BC), and the Empire (27 BC to 476 AD in the West, or 1453 AD in the East if the Byzantine Empire is included).
- The Republic's first 250 years were spent conquering the Italian peninsula; the second 250 years were spent conquering the entire Mediterranean basin.
- The Romans were "touchy about kings," so Augustus called himself *Princeps* (first citizen) and *Imperator* rather than rex (king) — the word "emperor" derives from *Imperator*, originally a spontaneous military acclamation shouted at victorious generals.
- The term *novus homo* ("new man") designated someone who was the first in their family to hold major office, and was treated as a remarkable novelty requiring a special label.

## Rome's Strategy of Integration

- Rome's early military dominance was not superior tactics or technology — it was near-limitless manpower drawn from incorporating conquered Italian peoples as half-citizens (*socii*) who were obligated to supply troops.
- Pyrrhus of Epirus, after defeating Roman armies twice, remarked that "fighting the Romans is like fighting a hydra" — cut off one head and two grow back — and abandoned the campaign rather than face a third army he could not match.
- Conquered Italian peoples were offered varying tiers: full citizenship, half-citizenship (*Latin rights*), or allied status; in exchange, they provided troops, not taxes — the army became the mechanism of Romanization.
- By the 2nd century AD, Roman emperors and senators were no longer Italians: Trajan and Hadrian came from Spain; Septimius Severus came from North Africa; later emperors came from Syria and elsewhere.
- The Roman auxiliary system absorbed 250,000 non-citizen soldiers serving alongside 250,000 legionaries; after 25 years of service, auxiliaries received Roman citizenship and their sons became legionaries — converting the most warlike enemies into the most loyal soldiers.

## Military Genius and Tactical Innovation

- Hannibal's plan to defeat Rome was strategically sound: invade Italy, win battles on Roman soil, and convince Rome's Italian allies that their freedom was worth more than Roman loyalty.
- At the Battle of Cannae (216 BC), Hannibal killed approximately 60,000 Romans in one afternoon — more deaths than Americans suffered in 20 years in Vietnam; the Battle of Gettysburg produced roughly 15,000 deaths over three days.
- Hannibal's double envelopment at Cannae — placing weak troops in the center to absorb and slow the Roman advance while superior forces encircled from both flanks — became the template for military encirclement from the German Blitzkrieg to the Gulf War's invasion of Iraq.
- The Roman legion's advantage over Alexander's sarissa phalanx was organizational flexibility: the legion was subdivided into contubernia (8 men), centuries (80 men), cohorts, and legions — allowing units to detach and attack flanks while the phalanx remained a single rigid mass.
- At the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC), the Roman legion defeated the Macedonian phalanx by breaking off a subunit, running around the side, and attacking from the flank — proving tactical flexibility more decisive than frontal striking power.
- Scipio defeated Hannibal at Zama (202 BC) not by confronting him in Italy but by threatening Carthage directly, forcing Hannibal to return and fight with exhausted veterans against a fresh, prepared Roman force.

## Ancient Armor and Experimental Archaeology

- The *linothorax* — body armor worn by Alexander the Great and documented in the Alexander Mosaic at Pompeii — was made entirely of linen and glue; no examples survive because organic materials decay.
- Aldrete's reconstruction project identified 65 literary references to the *linothorax* across 40 ancient authors, and approximately 1,000 images in vase paintings, bronze sculpture, and tomb paintings.
- Ballistic testing showed that a 1cm thick laminated linen breastplate provided protection roughly equivalent to 2mm of bronze armor — the thickest comparable body armor of the 5th–4th century BC.
- The *linothorax* weighed approximately 11 pounds versus 24–26 pounds for a comparable bronze cuirass and 27–28 pounds for a chain mail shirt — giving troops greater endurance in the Mediterranean heat.
- The *linothorax* could be produced domestically by any woman skilled in spinning and sewing — unlike metalwork requiring specialized smiths — making it accessible at the household level.
- The armor was likely produced in many variants (laminated, sewn, quilted, partially leather-reinforced) since every piece in the ancient world was handmade; the reconstruction investigated only the laminated linen form.
- The *linothorax* fell out of frontline use in the Roman period as steel-edged weapons and composite bows became common; by that era it survived as anti-assassination wear under the toga for emperors and as lion-hunting protection.

## Roman Law

- Approximately 90% of the world's legal systems are directly or indirectly derived from Roman law; Justinian's Code (6th century AD) compiled centuries of cases, commentary, and statute into the foundational document.
- The Twelve Tables (451 BC) — Rome's first codified law — focused on agrarian disputes: fruit falling onto a neighbor's land, livestock wandering into fields, and the use of magic.
- Roman citizenship came with a specific bundle of obligations (military service, voting) and privileges (protection of Roman law, guaranteed trial at Rome if accused); the cry *Civis Romanus Sum* ("I am a Roman citizen") was a legally meaningful assertion of rights.
- At the peak of the Empire (~2nd century AD), only about 6 million of the 50 million people within Roman borders held citizenship — the protections applied to a small minority of adult free men.
- High-profile law cases in the late Republic were held in the Roman Forum as public spectacle; Cicero's courtroom speeches were performed before thousands of bystanders who came to be entertained.
- A representative Roman legal puzzle: a ball thrown across an athletic field knocks a barber's hand, cutting a slave's throat — liability could attach to the thrower, the catcher, the barber, the slave's owner, or the city for zoning a barbershop adjacent to a playing field.

## Slavery

- Roman slavery was not racial — slaves could be of any ethnicity, origin, or gender; it was an economic status defined by the legal category of "object" rather than person.
- A Roman agricultural writer classified farm tools as "dumb tools" (shovels), "articulate tools" (animals), and "articulate tools" (slaves) — treating all three as undifferentiated instruments.
- The largest source of Roman slaves was conquest: slave traders followed Roman armies and purchased captives immediately after battles.
- Skilled slaves — doctors, scribes, accountants, barbers — were economically valuable investments; masters often allowed them to accumulate earnings toward purchasing their own freedom, creating an incentive structure that functioned as deferred wages.
- In the city of Rome, unskilled laborers at the docks were often free men while trained slaves held skilled positions — inverting the intuitive hierarchy.
- Some Roman slaves wore bronze collar tags inscribed with their owner's name, their habit of running away, and instructions to return them for a reward — physical evidence of the dehumanizing logic that treating a runaway slave as theft of property.

## Fall of the Republic

- The late Republic (133–31 BC) was characterized by nearly constant internal strife culminating in multiple rounds of civil war — not despite Rome's success but because of it: conquest created wealth that was distributed inequitably across veterans, allies, aristocrats, and slaves.
- Roman veterans returned from decades of campaigning to find they had no farms (sold during service) and no share of the conquest wealth; Italian allies who had stayed loyal through Hannibal's invasion still did not receive full citizenship; the aristocracy was increasingly locked out of the best appointments; slaves on the large plantations were openly miserable.
- A chain of strongmen — Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Caesar — each pushed republican norms further: Marius made armies loyal to their general rather than the state; Sulla marched on Rome itself; Pompey raised personal armies from private wealth; Caesar declared himself dictator for life.
- Caesar solved the problem of seizing power but not the problem of holding it: he named July after himself, dismissed the Senate's pretensions to equal standing, and was killed by 23 senators on the Ides of March 44 BC for "acting like a king."

## Augustus and the Architecture of Empire

- Octavian (later Augustus) defeated Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC by converting a Roman civil war into a war against a foreign enemy — framing Antony as a tool of Cleopatra, the enemy queen — through sustained propaganda.
- Augustus's political solution was to hold none of the traditional offices while being voted the powers of all of them simultaneously: the powers of consul (commanding armies, running Senate meetings), tribune (veto authority), and others, while the Republic's formal structure continued unchanged.
- Augustus lived modestly, ate simply, wore a plain toga, and treated senators with surface deference — deliberately avoiding every mistake Caesar made in the display of power.
- He titled his autobiography *Res Gestae* ("Stuff I Did"), called himself *Princeps* (first citizen) and *Augustus* (pious, or possibly divine — a deliberate ambiguity), and described his seizure of power as "defending the liberty of the Republic when it was oppressed by a faction."
- Augustus ruled for approximately 50 years; by the time he died, almost no one alive could remember the Republic, ensuring that the imperial system faced no nostalgic opposition.
- His dying words — "If I've played my part well, dismiss me from the stage with applause" — reveal self-awareness that his entire reign was a performance managing the public image of power.
- The title *Caesar* became "Czar" in Russian and "Kaiser" in German; *Princeps* became "prince"; *Imperator* became "emperor" — the vocabulary of rule for a millennium derived directly from Augustus's deliberately ambiguous titulature.

## Cicero, Oratory, and Rhetorical Manipulation

- Cicero was a *novus homo* — no famous ancestors, no military skill, no family wealth — who rose to the consulship (Rome's highest elected office) through oratory alone.
- Cicero believed people are fundamentally governed by emotion; he argued that if you can generate fear or anger in a jury, facts, evidence, and reason become secondary.
- His rhetorical manual techniques — mudslinging, guilt by association, ad hominem attacks, fearmongering, us-versus-them framing — are documented in three published handbooks he left behind and remain the standard toolkit of political persuasion.
- Cicero used physical props in court: he once delivered a defense oration cradling the defendant's newborn son; another time he positioned the defendant's weeping young boy behind him at the podium; in a third case he arranged the defendant's elderly parents in visible sight of the jury.
- Roman orators used a codified system of hand gestures, described in detail by Quintilian (*Institutio Oratoria*), where each gesture indicated an emotion the audience should feel — not a word meaning, but an emotional gloss applied on top of spoken words.
- Demosthenes, asked what the three most important elements of a speech were, replied: "Delivery, delivery, and delivery."

## Religion and the Rise of Christianity

- For most of Roman history, polytheism operated as a background assumption: gods were real but auxiliary to civic life, not the primary driver of decision-making; the state performed religious rituals on behalf of the empire without claiming to execute divine will.
- The conflict between Rome and early Christians arose from a specific friction: Romans required subjects to offer a prayer to the emperor's divine aspect as a loyalty test equivalent to reciting the Pledge of Allegiance; Christians experienced this as worshipping another god.
- A letter from Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan (~100 AD) shows that one of Rome's best-educated, most widely traveled administrators barely knew Christianity existed; he described it as a group that "swears oaths not to do bad stuff and then has breakfast together."
- Christianity's appeal was structurally coherent: it promised paradise in the afterlife (versus the unappealing Roman underworld of ghostly fields), declared all people equal in God's sight regardless of status or gender, and commanded its followers to perform visible charity — feeding the poor and caring for the sick.
- Early Christian congregations were disproportionately composed of women and slaves — the people at the bottom of the Roman status hierarchy whom Roman law explicitly excluded from equality.
- Emperors adopted Christianity because it solved their legitimacy problem: in a polytheistic world any general could claim divine backing; monotheism allowed only one legitimate emperor, the one God had chosen.

## Gladiators, the Colosseum, and Roman Architecture

- Gladiatorial combat ended in the combatant's death in approximately 10% of bouts according to documented matches; most fights ended with a skilled display between evenly matched opponents, comparable to modern boxing.
- Gladiators suffered "status dissonance": formally among the lowest in Roman society (mostly prisoners of war, legally slaves), they were simultaneously celebrities admired and desired by the public.
- The Flavian Amphitheater (Colosseum) was built by Vespasian (~80 AD) on the site of Nero's private Golden House as a deliberate political statement — replacing an emperor's pleasure palace with a venue for public entertainment, funded by the looting of Jerusalem.
- The Colosseum featured retractable awnings, elevator shafts for animals and scenery, numbered gates for efficient crowd flow, and a concrete structure that has outlasted its marble cladding by 2,000 years.
- The Pantheon's dome is engineered with variable concrete density — thicker, heavier formulations at the base and progressively lighter pumice-aggregate concrete toward the oculus — demonstrating sophisticated structural calculation rather than aesthetic accident.
- Roman architectural influence is nearly universal: virtually every capitol building, government courthouse, and museum in the Western world is a variant of the Pantheon's dome-with-pediment-and-columns template.

## Succession, Decline, and the Question of When Rome Fell

- Augustus failed to solve succession; he settled on blood heredity by default, producing emperors like Caligula and Nero when the nearest male relative happened to be psychologically unfit.
- The Five Good Emperors (Nerva through Marcus Aurelius, 96–180 AD) introduced meritocratic adoption — old emperors selected the most qualified successor and adopted them as a son — producing 80 years of stable, competent rule and the geographic peak of the Empire.
- Marcus Aurelius broke the adoption system by choosing his biological son Commodus, who turned out to be erratic; the historian Cassius Dio wrote that with this transition Rome descended "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron."
- The Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 AD) saw multiple generals simultaneously declaring themselves emperor, leaving borders undefended; barbarian raids destroyed farms, tax revenue collapsed, coinage was debased, and inflation spiraled.
- Diocletian stabilized the empire by issuing the *Solidus* (a guaranteed pure gold coin), publishing a maximum price edict for all goods and services (the most expensive item listed: legal advice), and experimenting with splitting governance among four co-emperors (the Tetrarchy).
- The conventional fall date of 476 AD — when a barbarian king deposed Romulus Augustulus — is one of many defensible endpoints; others include 410 (Alaric's sack of Rome), 180 (Marcus Aurelius's death), 31 BC (death of the Republic), or 1453 (fall of Constantinople).
- The Vandal conquest of North Africa and Spain cut off Rome's primary grain supply regions; the city's population collapsed as a direct result — making the food supply, not a single military defeat, the proximate cause of Rome's demographic and symbolic decline.

## Lessons from History

- The Roman civil wars of the late Republic (after Caesar's assassination) were in geographic scale effectively "world wars" of their era — fought simultaneously across Spain, North Africa, Greece, Egypt, and Italy by at least seven competing factions.
- Afghanistan has resisted every major invader from Alexander the Great through the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the United States by the same mechanism: mountainous terrain that provides refuge and tribal allegiances that resist centralized governance.
- Historians' biases shape what survives: women like Musa of Parthia (a slave who became the power behind the Parthian throne and secured Rome's greatest diplomatic achievement under Augustus) are systematically omitted from traditional histories focused on male political actors.
- The Roman historian Livy defined history's purpose as providing "an infinite variety of experiences and models — noble things to imitate, shameful things to avoid."
- Human civilization's special capability is the accumulation of knowledge across generations; curiosity — the drive to learn new things — is what sustains that process.

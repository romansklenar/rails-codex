# Mohammed El-Kurd: Palestine | Lex Fridman Podcast #391

A Palestinian poet and journalist raised in a home partially seized by Israeli settlers gives a ground-level account of dispossession in Sheikh Jarrah and argues that the conflict is fundamentally colonial, not religious.

## Sheikh Jarrah and the El-Kurd Family

- El-Kurd's grandmother was expelled from her home during the 1948 Nakba and arrived in Sheikh Jarrah in 1956, when it was established as a refugee housing unit by the UN and Jordanian government.
- In the 1970s, settler organizations registered in New York began claiming Sheikh Jarrah homes as theirs by "divine decree," filing cases in Israeli courts that refused to authenticate Ottoman, Jordanian, or UN documents.
- By 2009, the first wave of forced removals hit the neighborhood: an elderly man named Mohammed el-Kurd died of a stroke when soldiers pulled him from his home while he was urinating; the Darawi and Hannun families — 35 people — were expelled into the street.
- El-Kurd came home from school one day in 2009 to find his furniture scattered in the street and American-accented settlers living in half his house.
- Over 50 expulsion orders were accumulated between the 1970s and 2009 against the 28 families in Sheikh Jarrah.
- In 2020, while El-Kurd was completing a master's degree in New York, his father called with another expulsion order; El-Kurd returned to Jerusalem and launched a global campaign.
- The campaign succeeded in getting the Israeli Supreme Court to cancel all eviction orders in Sheikh Jarrah until further notice — a result El-Kurd attributes to international diplomatic pressure and grassroots media penetration.
- The campaign was run without institutional backing, budget, or media support, making its global reach historically unprecedented in Palestinian organizing.

## The Nakba and Its Continuation

- May 15, 1948 is commemorated as Nakba Day, but El-Kurd argues 1948 was a crystallization of Zionism rather than a discrete event — the Nakba is ongoing.
- Zionist paramilitaries destroyed over 500 villages, killed over 15,000 Palestinians, and expelled a majority of the Palestinian population in 1948, which El-Kurd describes as the near-total destruction of Palestinian society.
- The Balfour Declaration of 1917 committed Britain to establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, treating Palestinian land as Britain's to give away.
- Ze'ev Jabotinsky, pioneer of Revisionist Zionism and founder of the Irgun, wrote explicitly that Palestine must be colonized by force and compared Palestinians to "Red Indians"; he is still honored with street names in Israel and was publicly celebrated by Netanyahu shortly before the recording.
- The Irgun was responsible for the Deir Yassin massacre and the bombing of the King David Hotel; it later merged into the Israeli military.
- The Israeli government classified 90% of historic Palestine as state-owned land in the 1960s, land that had been cultivated by Palestinian farmers for generations.
- Since Israel's establishment, Jewish-only towns have been built regularly; not a single Palestinian town has been permitted to emerge in that period.

## The Legal System as a Tool of Dispossession

- East Jerusalem is under occupation under international law; El-Kurd argues Israeli jurisdiction there is entirely illegitimate, yet Palestinians have no alternative courts to use.
- Israeli courts refuse to authenticate documents from the Ottoman or Jordanian periods, meaning Palestinian land claims that predate Israel's founding have no standing.
- 95% of building permit applications submitted by Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank are rejected by Israeli authorities, according to a spokesperson for the Israeli military.
- Yonatan Yosef, the Jerusalem councilman responsible for approving building permits, is an active settler who has publicly chanted "Nakba now" with a megaphone in Sheikh Jarrah.
- The judge ruling on whether Masafer Yatta Bedouin communities can remain in their homes is himself a settler in the West Bank — illegal under international law.
- Eyad al-Halaq, an autistic Palestinian man, was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier inside the occupied old city; the soldier was acquitted despite broad daylight documentation.
- Palestinian victims of administrative detention are held without charge or trial; the Israeli Supreme Court has never granted release to any Palestinian held in this manner.
- The Israeli Family Reunification Law prevents Palestinian couples with different legal statuses from living together.

## Palestinian Legal Classifications and the Wall

- Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue ID cards granting residency but not citizenship, even for families whose roots in the city span many generations.
- Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in cities like Haifa can travel and vote but face over 60 discriminatory laws, land confiscations, and community growth restrictions.
- West Bank Palestinians hold green IDs and cannot leave the West Bank without special permits; within the West Bank they navigate Israeli military checkpoints and settler violence between towns.
- Gaza's 2 million residents have no freedom of movement and face blockades on water, food, healthcare, and imports; the UN has deemed Gaza uninhabitable.
- The separation wall, completed in 2003 at nine meters high, confiscated thousands of dunams of Palestinian land and physically divided families who had lived across the street from each other.
- George W. Bush described the West Bank as "Swiss cheese" because Israeli settlements and military checkpoints appear every few hundred meters throughout Palestinian territory.
- Nearly 1 million Israeli settlers now live in the West Bank.

## The Zionism-Religion Distinction

- Many of the original Zionist founders — and many current Israeli leaders — were and are secular atheists; framing the conflict as a religious war between Muslims and Jews is a convenient distraction.
- Marketing the conflict as a religious dispute allows international audiences to dismiss it as ancient and irresolvable, obscuring its modern colonial political origins.
- Christian Zionism, exemplified by Pastor John Hagee (founder of Christians United for Israel), is one of Israel's closest allies, even though Hagee has said Hitler was sent to "hunt" the Jews and that Jewish people will perish in hell — views Netanyahu has never condemned.
- Netanyahu's equation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism conflates opposition to a secular political movement founded in the 19th century with hatred of a religion thousands of years old.
- The ADL, which labeled El-Kurd an antisemite, is also the largest non-governmental police training department in the US, has engaged in surveillance of Black liberation and anti-Apartheid movements, and in Charlottesville advised police to spy on Black organizers opposing white supremacists.

## Resistance, Violence, and the Ukraine Double Standard

- El-Kurd argues that resistance to occupation — including armed resistance — is recognized under international law and has been practiced by every colonized people throughout history.
- Sky News aired instructions for making Molotov cocktails in Ukraine; the New York Times quoted a Ukrainian psychologist saying hatred of all Russians is a healthy outlet; the New York Post praised a Ukrainian suicide bomber as heroic — coverage that would be impossible for Palestinians.
- Palestinian resistance is called terrorism; Ukrainian resistance is called heroism; El-Kurd argues the difference is not the act but the race, accent, and uniform of those doing it.
- After the July 2023 Jenin raid — more than 1,000 Israeli soldiers backed by drone strikes, the largest West Bank operation since 2005 — Israeli soldiers with megaphones ordered hundreds of Palestinians to flee at gunpoint, repeating the logic of the 1948 expulsions.
- El-Kurd notes that some people forced to flee Jenin in 2023 were the same people forced out of Haifa in 1948, making the perpetual exile generational and literal.
- El-Kurd is not convinced violence alone is effective given the extreme power asymmetry: Palestinians have makeshift weapons; Israel has one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world and is the only regional nuclear power.

## Obstacles to Peace and the Two-State Solution

- El-Kurd cites lawyer Robert Barre's framework: justice requires recognition, return, and redistribution — recognition of the Nakba, right of return for refugees, and redistribution of confiscated land.
- A two-state solution is geographically impossible, El-Kurd argues, because Israeli settlements are distributed throughout the West Bank like Swiss cheese.
- A two-state solution also fails Palestinians in Haifa, Nazareth, and Jaffa — cities inside pre-1967 Israel — who would be excluded from any Palestinian state.
- The Palestinian Authority is described as a subcontractor of the Israeli regime through security coordination; it killed opposition activist Nizar Banat in 2021.
- Hamas was democratically elected in 2006 but El-Kurd questions whether it is equipped to govern and whether Palestinians broadly want to live under Hamas rule.
- The only entity with actual power to change conditions on the ground, El-Kurd argues, is Israel itself, as it controls the cage.
- Israeli Supreme Court protests in Tel Aviv were defended by Israeli liberals as saving a progressive institution, while that same court has legalized settlement expansion, upheld administrative detention, and never freed a single Palestinian held without trial.

## Role of the United States

- The US has provided Israel $158 billion in aid since World War II and currently sends $3.8 billion annually in military aid.
- Israel is the largest recipient of US foreign aid since World War II.
- Only nine members of Congress boycotted Israeli President Herzog's address; the remainder gave repeated standing ovations.
- El-Kurd argues US public opinion on Palestine is shifting "drastically" but Washington has not kept pace; he sees organizing in the US diaspora and among American taxpayers as a primary leverage point.
- The Abraham Accords are characterized as arms deals and economic arrangements between unelected Arab governments and Israel, not as genuine peace agreements; Morocco's normalization was conditioned on Israel recognizing Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.

## Ghassan Kanafani and the Three Enemies

- Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated at age 35–37 in the early 1970s, was a writer and member of the PFLP whose work El-Kurd describes as foundational to Palestinian political consciousness.
- Kanafani identified three obstacles to Palestinian liberation between 1936 and 1939 that El-Kurd maps onto the present: local reactionary leadership (today: the Palestinian Authority), surrounding Arab regimes (today: the Abraham Accords states — UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan), and the imperialist-Zionist enemy (Israel backed by the US).
- Kanafani's most famous interview line: "You mean capitulation? You can't have a conversation between the sword and the neck" — his response when a British journalist asked why Palestinians wouldn't negotiate with Israelis.

## Poetry, Writing, and Language

- El-Kurd's poetry collection "Rifqa" is named after his grandmother — a name meaning "to accompany someone" in both Arabic and Hebrew.
- His grandmother's poems were submitted to a local Jerusalem newspaper and returned with words redacted by Israeli military censors; she and her husband would guess which lines would be cut as a morning game.
- A Palestinian poet with Israeli citizenship was imprisoned for several months in recent years for publishing a poem on Facebook that said "Resist, my people. Resist."
- El-Kurd writes in English deliberately to bridge the gap between what is said in Arabic on Palestinian streets and what reaches international audiences.
- In Arabic he can philosophize and nuance his writing about violence and resistance; in English he is compelled to spend space establishing basic facts of occupation that remain contested in Western discourse.
- His forthcoming memoir, tentatively titled "A Million States in One," documents the 2009 and 2020–21 expulsion attempts in Sheikh Jarrah and the behind-the-scenes of the global campaign that stopped them.
- The book is framed around dignity and humor, rejecting the expectation that Palestinians must be polite in their suffering.
- A study found 52% of Palestinians have depression; El-Kurd believes the true figure is significantly higher.

## Hope and Palestinian Resilience

- El-Kurd grounds hope in historical pattern: no injustice has persisted indefinitely; Jim Crow, slavery, the Holocaust, and Algerian colonialism were all once legal and contested, and are now universally condemned.
- Palestinian mothers who appear to cheer when their sons are killed by Israeli forces are not celebrating death, but refusing to let the occupier see their spirit broken — a specific act of defiance against a system designed to demoralize.
- Palestinians in Israeli prisons study and earn degrees; some have smuggled sperm out of prison to father children — acts of sustained commitment to life against a carceral system meant to extinguish it.
- El-Kurd describes Palestinians as fundamentally stubborn rather than resilient: "You demolish the home in Jerusalem and the people say, 'Don't worry. We'll build another.'"
- He frames his own work not as driven by inspiration or strength but as obligation: "There is a great travesty taking place in the world and I have been put in a place where I'm able to talk about it. I have to do it."

# Serhii Plokhy: History of Ukraine, Russia, Soviet Union, KGB, Nazis & War | Lex Fridman Podcast #415

A Harvard historian of Eastern Europe dismantles the mythologies surrounding Ukrainian and Russian identity by placing the current war inside a 1,000-year arc of imperial rise and collapse.

## Collapse of the Soviet Union

- Plokhy distinguishes three separate 1991 processes: collapse of communism as ideology, end of the Cold War, and disintegration of the Soviet Union — conflating them produces wrong explanations.
- The Soviet collapse is the continuation of the disintegration of the Russian Empire that began in 1917, temporarily arrested by internationalist Bolshevik ideology, and resumed in full force in the late 1980s.
- The US actively opposed Soviet dissolution: George H.W. Bush traveled to Kyiv in August 1991 to warn Ukrainians against independence in the infamous "Chicken Kiev" speech.
- Ukraine's December 1, 1991 independence referendum triggered the Soviet dissolution one week later; Yeltsin told Bush that without Ukraine, Russia would be outnumbered by Muslim republics and had no interest in continuing the project.
- Chief Yeltsin economic adviser Yegor Gaidar argued Russia could no longer afford to subsidize other republics and needed to redirect oil and gas revenue internally.
- Putin's description of the Soviet collapse as "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century" is about the loss of great-power status and the division of people he considers Russian, not about loss of life.
- The 20th century's defining macro-event was the redrawing of the world map and the creation of dozens of new states from collapsing empires — Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union all disintegrated in the same era.

## Origins of Russia and Ukraine

- Slavic peoples originated in the Pripyat Marshes region (northwestern Ukraine, southwestern Belarus, eastern Poland) and spread from there to the Adriatic and the Pacific.
- Kievan Rus was founded by Vikings establishing control over the trade route between the northern forest zone and Constantinople, with Kyiv positioned at the border between forest and steppe.
- The term "Kievan Rus" is a 19th-century coinage; the people of that time called themselves simply "Rus," a name that belonged to all groups on that territory, not exclusively to Russians.
- Moscow is first mentioned in the 12th century as a city founded by a Kievan prince; it rose to prominence specifically under Mongol rule, competing for Tatar favor against the city of Vladimir.
- The lands that became Ukraine and Belarus were liberated from Mongol control by the Lithuanians; central and western Russia remained under Mongol dominion until the late 15th century.
- Russian historians described Moscow's subsequent expansion as "the gathering of the Russian lands," a project Plokhy argues was only completed in 1945 when the Soviet Union absorbed Transcarpathian Ukraine.
- The "Russian Empire" as a term and concept is an 18th-century construction, not a medieval one.

## Ukrainian Nationalism and the Cossack Myth

- The anonymous manuscript "The History of the Rus," circulating from the 1820s, claimed Cossacks were the original Rus people and deserved a privileged place in the Russian Empire.
- The text captivated Pushkin, the executed Decembrist poet Ryleyev, and Taras Shevchenko — each reading it through a different lens; Russian nationalist writers later called it "the Quran of Ukrainian nationalism."
- The manuscript's core move was shifting from a claim based on estate rights (Cossack officers should have noble status) to a claim based on nationhood — a switch from imperial loyalty to ethnic identity that no empire could survive.
- Ukrainian national identity manifested in two distinct forms in the 20th century: national communism inside Soviet Ukraine, and radical nationalism in the parts of Ukraine controlled by Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.
- There were five Ukrainian declarations of independence in the 20th century before 1991; only the fifth succeeded.
- In 1991, the majority of Ukrainian parliament members who voted for independence were Communist Party members — the national spirit persisted inside Soviet structures.

## Stepan Bandera

- Bandera was a student activist in Polish-controlled western Ukraine in the late 1920s who felt his generation had missed the liberation struggles of WWI and concluded that radical nationalism and political violence were necessary.
- He was sentenced to death (later commuted to life imprisonment) for organizing assassinations of Polish officials; his defiant courtroom speeches turned him into a youth hero.
- On the first day of the Nazi invasion of the USSR in 1941, Bandera's units marched into Lviv and declared Ukrainian independence — an act not sanctioned by Germany; the Nazis arrested Bandera, and his two brothers died in Auschwitz.
- Bandera spent most of the period 1930–1959 outside Ukraine: in a Polish prison, a German concentration camp (Sachsenhausen), or exile in Munich; he was assassinated by KGB agent Bohdan Stashynsky in 1959.
- Soviet and then Russian propaganda applied the "Nazi collaborator" label to Bandera using the same window of time when Stalin himself collaborated with Hitler under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
- The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists explicitly refused to call themselves fascists even in 1939–1941, when doing so would have been diplomatically advantageous with Germany — they insisted on the label "nationalist revolutionaries."
- Plokhy finds no documentary evidence of personal anti-Semitism from Bandera himself, though anti-Semites existed in his circle.
- Neo-Nazis and white supremacists are present in Ukraine but are more marginal than equivalent groups in Central Europe or the US; their continuing marginality even during wartime is the phenomenon requiring explanation.

## KGB: Structure, Power, and Putin's Formation

- KGB assassin Bohdan Stashynsky was recruited by blackmail: Soviet security forced him to betray a partisan connected to his family, making return to civilian life impossible and turning the secret police into his surrogate family.
- Stashynsky killed two OUN leaders using a spray pistol — the weapon that Ian Fleming later incorporated into "The Man with the Golden Gun" (the novel, not the film).
- Stashynsky defected with his German wife two hours before the Berlin Wall closed the border, going to US intelligence and demanding to be prosecuted in order to establish his testimony publicly.
- After the Stashynsky scandal, the KGB substantially reduced political assassinations abroad because the political cost was too high — the KGB chief who ordered the Bandera killing, Shelepin, was eventually removed from the Politburo by Brezhnev using it against him.
- Under Khrushchev the KGB was deliberately weakened; Andropov restored it to full political power in the 1970s, eventually succeeding Brezhnev as General Secretary.
- Unlike the CIA (which provides intelligence to decision-makers), the KGB was itself part of the inner decision-making circle; the Afghanistan invasion decision was made by a trio that included KGB chief Andropov.
- Putin's 16 years in KGB foreign intelligence instilled a worldview in which foreign policy is conceived as a series of planned operations, and the absence of party oversight is experienced as freedom rather than accountability.

## Road to War: Orange Revolution to 2022

- The 2004 Orange Revolution rejected election fraud that favored Russia-backed Yanukovych; the resulting pro-Western president Yushchenko put NATO membership on the agenda for the first time.
- The 2013 Revolution of Dignity began as a protest over Yanukovych's last-minute refusal to sign the EU Association Agreement — itself reversed under Moscow's pressure to keep Ukraine out of the Eurasian Union project.
- The protests escalated from economic grievance to mass uprising when police beat students who were already dispersing; roughly half of Kyiv took to the streets in response.
- Putin's 2021 essay "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians" reprised pre-Bolshevik imperial ideology — the claim that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians form one people — tracing its intellectual lineage to 19th-century Russian nationalist thought preserved by the Russian Orthodox Church.
- The Russian Orthodox Church never underwent the post-1917 national recognition reform that Soviet state institutions did; it continued carrying the imperial conception of one unified Russian nation intact into the 21st century.
- Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 not to acquire territory for its own sake but to prevent Ukraine from drifting permanently into the Western orbit; Donbas was then used as a lever to keep Ukraine unstable, not as territory Russia sought to possess.
- Donbas became an ethnic powder keg through Soviet-era industrialization that imported Russian workers from across the empire; in Mariupol, ethnic Russians constituted over 40% of the population.
- The war's first provocateurs in Donbas — including Igor Girkin, who became "defense minister" of the Donetsk People's Republic — were Moscow residents with direct connections to Russian intelligence, not organic local leaders.

## Ukraine's Identity and Language

- Before 2014, Ukraine was genuinely bilingual in a way Plokhy had not seen in any other country: a speaker of either Ukrainian or Russian was understood and answered in the other language without friction, in any region.
- Loss of Crimea and industrial Donbas shifted the demographic balance toward predominantly Ukrainian-speaking regions, accelerating a linguistic identity shift already underway among younger Ukrainians.
- Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute's MAPA Digital Atlas documented spikes in self-reported Ukrainian language use in 2014–2015, followed by partial reversion by 2016–2017; the 2022 invasion produced a far larger and likely more durable shift.
- Ukrainian national identity formed through repeated rebellion against the state; Russian identity formed around the state and has difficulty imagining itself outside it — a distinction Plokhy calls part of each nation's "political DNA."
- The Maidan's success where Bolotnaya Square (Moscow 2012) failed reflects this DNA difference: police violence ended Russian protests and started Ukrainian ones.

## NATO, Peace Talks, and War Scenarios

- At the 2008 Bucharest NATO summit, Putin convinced Merkel and Sarkozy to block Ukraine and Georgia's Membership Action Plans; Western leaders told Putin repeatedly in 2021 that Ukraine had no realistic near-term path to membership.
- Finland joining NATO after the 2022 invasion doubled the Russia-NATO land border without producing any Russian troop redeployment northward — confirming for Plokhy that NATO expansion was a pretext, not a primary cause.
- Putin's fall 2022 annexation of five Ukrainian oblasts into the Russian constitution made a return to pre-2022 borders legally and politically impossible without regime change in Moscow; Zelensky issued a corresponding decree banning negotiations with Russia.
- Peace talks in spring 2022 collapsed because Russia's demands — denazification, territorial concessions, and permanent exclusion from Western security structures — were, in Ukraine's assessment, terms for a slow-motion takeover rather than a genuine settlement.
- Plokhy dismisses the claim that Boris Johnson derailed the 2022 Istanbul talks: he interviewed participants who denied it, and finds it implausible that Zelensky would act against his own judgment on another leader's instruction.
- Ukraine's primary military success in 2023 was on the Black Sea, where it pushed the Russian Navy westward and restored grain exports through Odessa to approximately 75% of pre-war levels.
- Zelensky's February 2024 dismissal of General Zaluzhny is analogous to Truman firing MacArthur — a dangerous transition during active war — and raises unresolved questions about changes in operational strategy.

## Holodomor and 20th-Century Ideological Violence

- The Holodomor (1932–1934) killed approximately 4 million Ukrainians through forced collectivization; the December 1932 decree by Stalin and Molotov simultaneously mandated grain seizure and banned Ukrainian-language publications in other Soviet republics.
- Ukraine was the only territory where grain seizure policies coincided with the simultaneous purge of the political leadership, persecution of Ukrainian cultural institutions, and restrictions on Ukrainianization.
- Plokhy connects Holodomor, the Holocaust, and Mao's famine as a specifically 20th-century phenomenon — the first era when dominant ideologies not only devalued human life but treated mass destruction of population groups as the path to progress.
- Pre-20th-century empires sought to exploit conquered populations as productive labor or settlers; the shift to ideologically motivated mass killing represents a civilizational rupture that Plokhy believes has not been adequately internalized.

## Chernobyl and Nuclear Risk

- Chernobyl's RBMK reactor was a dual-purpose design that could produce enriched uranium, making it classified; safety problems were concealed even from the plant's own operators.
- The core Soviet institutional failure at Chernobyl was that no one on the ground had authority to make consequential decisions without Moscow's approval — moving Pripyat's population required sign-off from the very top.
- Three Mile Island (US) vs. Chernobyl: in the American legal and managerial culture, on-site operators had genuine decision-making authority; at Chernobyl, the arrival of a high official caused everyone to defer upward.
- Chernobyl's information suppression produced "eco-nationalism" in Ukraine: the first mass mobilizations that preceded independence were not about language or autonomy but demands to know whether people were living in contaminated zones.
- In Ukraine, radiation cut across all social divisions — party membership offered no protection — making Chernobyl the rare grievance that united everyone.
- Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (Europe's largest) experienced the same preconditions as Fukushima — shutdown reactors requiring external electricity for cooling — multiple times during the war, with artillery fire playing the role of the tsunami.
- None of the world's 440 reactors was designed to withstand direct missile attack or operate under warfare conditions; operator error risk multiplies when workers fear for their families and do not know if the next strike will hit the control room.
- Major nuclear accidents reliably freeze global reactor construction for at least a decade: Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima each produced a global freeze; Germany shut down its reactors after Fukushima and burned more coal as a result.

## The Cold War Returns and Nuclear Lessons

- Plokhy sees the current global order as a return to Cold War bipolarity — but with Beijing replacing Moscow as Washington's primary antagonist, while Russia is substantially diminished.
- Russia's goal since the 1990s was a multipolar world with itself as one pole on par with China, the EU, and the US; the 2022 war has made that vision implausible.
- The right Cold War question, Plokhy argues, is not "what went wrong?" but "how did we avoid a world war for over 70 years after WWII?" — understanding how to keep the Cold War cold is the critical lesson.
- The Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved not because of nuclear weapons but because of leaders' fear of them: both Kennedy and Khrushchev belonged to the generation that witnessed Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb tests and were viscerally afraid of nuclear war.
- The most dangerous moment of the Cuban crisis — a Soviet SAM shooting down a U-2 and killing the pilot — occurred without Moscow's knowledge or authorization, illustrating that top leaders never fully control events on the ground.
- Current and future political leaders have no personal memory of Bikini Atoll; the generational loss of nuclear fear is, for Plokhy, one of the most serious risks facing the 21st century.

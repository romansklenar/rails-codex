# Jeffrey Wasserstrom: China, Xi Jinping, Trade War, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mao | Lex Fridman Podcast #466

A historian of modern China uses deep archival knowledge and eyewitness presence at the 1986 and 1989 protests to make sense of how Xi Jinping's orderly authoritarianism is both a continuation of and a departure from Mao's revolutionary chaos.

## Xi Jinping and Mao Compared

- Both leaders have been the center of sustained personality cults; Xi is the first since Mao where his books dominate bookstores and his face and quotes pervade public space.
- After Mao's death, party norms actively suppressed personality cults — leaders' speeches were not published until after their tenure ended; Wasserstrom experienced this firsthand in China in 1986.
- Mao reveled in disorder and identified with the Monkey King legend of "turning heaven upside down"; Xi prizes stability, predictability, and controlled hierarchy.
- Mao denounced Confucianism as feudal and backward; Xi publicly celebrates Confucius as part of Chinese greatness, marking a philosophical reversal.
- Xi claims both Mao and Confucius as heroes despite their irreconcilability, fusing them under a single nationalist umbrella of Chinese greatness.
- The first Qin emperor (221 BC) burned books and opposed scholars — Mao sided with him over Confucius; Xi invokes the Great Wall (actually built centuries later) as a symbol without choosing between them.
- Xi Jinping's combination of one-party rule and Confucian celebration mirrors the platform Chiang Kai-shek held in Taiwan — his ideological rival in the civil war.

## Confucianism and the Chinese Political Tradition

- Confucius lived around the same time as Socrates (~500 BC) and, like Socrates, is known mostly through followers' writings and attributed dialogues.
- The core Confucian claim: all people are similar at birth but differentiated by learning — a basis for meritocracy but also for education-through-emulation of past sages.
- Every Confucian relationship is hierarchical and reciprocal: father owes son care, son owes father respect; even brotherhood has only "older brother" and "younger brother," never equals.
- The emperor was "son of heaven," making the political hierarchy continuous with the cosmic order — rulers governed by the Mandate of Heaven.
- Confucianism is fundamentally backward-looking: Confucius argued that a golden age of proper relationships existed in the past and must be recovered, not that history progresses forward.
- Mencius added that a ruler who fails moral duties loses the Mandate of Heaven, implicitly justifying rebellion — successful rebellion retroactively proves heaven withdrew the mandate.
- The Tang-dynasty civil service exam system institutionalized Confucian meritocracy: family clans pooled resources to prepare the brightest member, but richer families could afford better tutors.
- Failed examination candidates led major Chinese rebellions — the system generated outrage when seen as corrupt or nepotistic.

## Education, Meritocracy, and the Gaokao

- The Gaokao college entrance exam is the contemporary successor to the imperial civil service exam; it functions as a career-determining threshold exam.
- The 1989 Tiananmen protests were triggered in large part by anger at nepotism and corruption — students saw the Communist Party handing positions through the "back door" while demanding students earn their way through exams.
- The Communist Party did not execute the last Qing emperor; instead, it "re-educated" him into a citizen — a Confucian-inflected belief that anyone can be remolded through education.
- Wasserstrom observes a pattern across Chinese history: leaders value scholars and educated officials, but scholars are also the hardest social class for rulers to control.

## Tiananmen Square 1989

- The 1989 protests began as a call for the Communist Party to live up to its own stated ideals of reform and opening up, not as a movement to overthrow the party.
- Wasserstrom was in Shanghai in 1986 for warm-up protests: students were furious that Jan and Dean performed a rock concert but security guards forced dancing students to sit down — a symbol of "fake openness."
- The 1986 authorities used the accusation of "new Red Guardism" to suppress protests; students, who did not want to be associated with Cultural Revolution chaos, backed down.
- 1989 was a resonant year: the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution and, more importantly, the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which had helped found the CCP itself.
- Hu Yaobang's unexpected death triggered the protests — he was demoted after taking a lenient stance toward the 1986 protests, and students posted banners saying "the wrong people are dying."
- The People's Daily editorial calling the protests "chaos" was a coded signal invoking Cultural Revolution fears; the students rejected the characterization and stayed in the square.
- When independent labor unions formed and workers joined students, the government ordered the military in — the CCP could tolerate student protests but not a cross-class coalition.
- The massacre occurred the night of June 3rd–4th; the People's Liberation Army, meant to defend China from foreign aggression, acted like an occupying force against its own citizens.
- Wasserstrom argues 1989 was more like Prague Spring 1968 — reforming socialism, not ending it — than like the simultaneous anti-communist revolutions in Eastern Europe.

## The Tank Man and the Power of Images

- The Tank Man image (June 5, 1989) shows a lone person — probably a worker, not a student — blocking a column of tanks on a boulevard near Tiananmen Square carrying shopping bags.
- The Chinese government initially showed Tank Man footage to claim army restraint: the tank swerved, didn't run him over; they emphasized soldiers burned alive in tanks by crowds as the real martyrs.
- That narrative failed because too many Beijing residents personally knew people killed in the initial firing on unarmed civilians with automatic weapons.
- The image was then suppressed because it depicts the People's Liberation Army as an invading force — fatally undermining the party's claim to legitimate authority.
- Wasserstrom assumes the Tank Man was disappeared and killed; Liu Xiaobo by contrast got a show trial before dying of untreated cancer in custody.
- In 2022 a man hung protest banners on the Sitong bridge in Beijing denouncing Xi Jinping's Covid policies and authoritarian rule; he also disappeared without trial, the party unwilling to create a platform for his account.
- The CCP learned from Tiananmen: during Hong Kong protests (2014, 2019) it kept soldiers off the streets entirely, using police with tear gas, rubber bullets, and bean-bag shot to avoid iconic massacre imagery.
- Xinjiang detention camps are explicitly kept off-camera; the party is now acutely aware of how a single photograph can delegitimize a regime.

## Censorship: Fear, Friction, and Flooding

- Margaret Roberts's framework identifies three censorship mechanisms: fear (direct punishment), friction (making banned information harder to access), and flooding (saturating the information environment with the approved narrative).
- Fear is used selectively against high-profile targets — journalists, activists, dissidents — not the average citizen; the average citizen is controlled more by friction and flooding.
- VPN use is common among tech-savvy Chinese citizens but requires ongoing effort — updating software, slower speeds — which itself functions as a friction tax.
- George Orwell's 1984 has been legally available in Chinese bookstores since 1985; it is not banned because it is not explicitly about China, and some readers saw it as a critique of the Cultural Revolution past rather than the present.
- By the 1990s some Chinese readers contrasted 1984's world of scarcity with China's growing consumer abundance — McDonald's, supermarkets, fast trains — arguing the parallel didn't apply.
- Wasserstrom frames post-1989 China as closer to Brave New World: the CCP's post-Tiananmen social compact offered more consumer choices, more cultural freedom, more private life, in exchange for continued one-party political rule.
- Aldous Huxley taught George Orwell at Eton; in October 1949 — the same month the CCP took power — Huxley wrote Orwell that future dictators would find less "arduous" means of control, closer to his vision than Orwell's.
- A Shanghai liberal bookstore that hosted freewheeling discussions of ideas in the 2000s was forced to close under Xi Jinping's tightening and has reopened in Washington DC as JF Books.
- A similar Hong Kong bookstore relocated to upstate New York; a network of "Nowhere Bookstores" has opened in Chiang Mai, Taipei, The Hague, and Japan — carrying on conversations no longer possible inside China.

## Xi Jinping's Consolidation of Power

- Xi Jinping took power in late 2012; the narrowing of civic space began around 2008 (Beijing Olympics) as the CCP felt more confident after decades of economic growth and after the global financial crisis hit Western countries.
- Xi's power structure is a near-total black box; even veteran China specialists cannot map factional power bases inside the party the way they could under earlier leaders.
- A leaked Xi speech reveals he believes the Soviet Union collapsed because its leaders abandoned ideology and were not "manly enough" — the same critique he and Putin likely share of Gorbachev.
- Xi narrowed the space for diverse Chinese identities — Muslim identity in Xinjiang, Mongolian language in Inner Mongolia, Hong Kong's separate civic culture — imposing a singular vision of Chineseness.
- The book Let Only Red Flowers Bloom by Emily Fang (NPR) documents this narrowing under Xi as its central thesis.
- Xi pushed against feminist movements within China — consistent with a Confucian-inflected patriarchal revival — while his wife Peng Liyuan is a prominent celebrity, paralleling Chiang Kai-shek's high-profile wife.
- Xi does not give press conferences or spontaneous interviews; Jiang Zemin gave a wide-ranging Barbara Walters interview touching on Tiananmen, but Xi's public statements are fully scripted.
- Xi's stated literary enthusiasms (Hemingway, Victor Hugo) appear formulaic; Victor Hugo has been safe in China partly because he condemned the European destruction of the Old Summer Palace in 1860.

## The Trade War of 2025

- In April 2025 Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%; Xi responded with 125% tariffs on US goods and suspended exports of rare earth minerals and magnets critical to US manufacturing.
- China also restricted Hollywood film imports and limited certain American companies' operations in China.
- Xi framed China as the "responsible superpower" supporting multilateral trade rules on a Southeast Asia tour, positioning Beijing against "unilateral bullying."
- Xi invoked Mao's 1953 Korean War speech ("We will never yield") in domestic propaganda — appealing to the Century of National Humiliation (1840s–1940s) narrative.
- The "hundred years of humiliation" is the CCP's foundational legitimating story: the party exists to prevent China from ever again being bullied by foreign powers.
- Wasserstrom warns against bilateral framing: the Sino-Soviet split, not just Nixon, is what made US-China rapprochement possible; 9/11 dramatically reset the trajectory of US-China tensions; third parties (India, Southeast Asia, Europe) are key variables now.
- Chinese blogger Han Han once quipped that Americans would not bomb the Three Gorges Dam because Apple's iPhones are made downstream — economic interdependence as a check on military conflict.
- Xi's ability to appear as a stable, reasonable counterpart to Trump's unpredictability gives him soft-power gains; the CCP can use aggressive US rhetoric domestically to justify the party's necessity.

## Taiwan and One Country, Two Systems

- One Country, Two Systems was designed in 1984 as part of the deal transferring Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997, and was explicitly proposed by Beijing as a model for Taiwan's eventual absorption.
- Hong Kong Island became British after the first Opium War (1842); the New Territories were a 99-year lease expiring in 1997; their energy, water, and food dependence on the mainland made a partial handover unworkable.
- Beijing went easy on Hong Kong from 1997 to roughly 2008: it wanted WTO membership, the 2008 Olympics, and depended heavily on Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; Hong Kong University and CUHK outranked all mainland universities at the time.
- As mainland universities rose in global rankings and Hong Kong's economic indispensability shrank, Beijing grew less patient with Hong Kong's differences.
- Hong Kong activists hung a banner in 2014 reading "Taiwan, beware — Hong Kong today is Taiwan's tomorrow," inverting Beijing's original One Country, Two Systems pitch.
- The pattern repeated in Tibet: a 1950s One Country, Two Systems-type arrangement collapsed by 1959 when Beijing lost patience and the Dalai Lama fled into exile.
- Taiwan's Taiwanese identity has strengthened precisely because of what happened to Hong Kong; parties willing to negotiate closer ties with Beijing now poll poorly.
- Wasserstrom believes a military move on Taiwan would most likely stem from Xi's domestic weakness or desperation, not strength; a confident Xi projecting global stability is less likely to take the risk.
- The year 2049 — the centenary of Communist China — and 2047 — the formal expiry of One Country, Two Systems — are symbolically loaded dates that Taiwan watches carefully.

## Hong Kong Protests (2012–2020)

- A 2012 attempt to impose mainland-style patriotic education in Hong Kong was defeated by youth protesters — the only time Beijing blinked in Hong Kong since 1997.
- 2014's Umbrella Movement demanded genuine electoral choice for the chief executive; Beijing held the line and the protest ended without concessions.
- 2019's protests began over an extradition bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be tried on the mainland — threatening Hong Kong's independent rule of law and courts.
- After the 2019 protests the National Security Law was imposed, effectively ending the "two systems" component; COVID provided cover for the crackdown.
- Wasserstrom attributes youth militancy to rational time horizons: a 17-year-old in 2019 would spend most of their adult life in a post-autonomy Hong Kong; a person of 80 could afford to counsel patience.
- Hong Kong protest tactics — particularly "be water" (flexible, non-confrontational swarming) — were adopted by protesters in Thailand, Belarus, and Minneapolis in 2020.
- The "Hong Kong spirit" now lives in diaspora communities; Geremie Barmé's concept of the "other China" — cosmopolitan, Taoist, non-nationalist — frames what Hong Kong represented culturally.

## Mao's Rise and the Civil War

- China was ruled by emperors until 1911; the fall of the Qing dynasty combined ethnic Han nationalism (against Manchu rulers) with republican reformers — a contradictory coalition.
- Mao was a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party, formed in 1921 by May Fourth Movement intellectuals inspired by Marxism and by the nearby Russian Revolution.
- Lenin's anti-imperialism was the key attraction: the newly formed Soviet Union renounced Tsarist Russia's Chinese territorial concessions in a dramatic gesture.
- Sun Yat-sen held the Nationalist Party and Communist Party in alliance despite ideological differences — both agreed on defeating warlords and foreign imperialism; the alliance collapsed after his death in 1925 when Chiang Kai-shek purged the communists in 1927.
- Mao's decisive ideological innovation: in Marxist orthodoxy revolution comes from urban workers; Mao argued China's peasantry could be the revolutionary vanguard — a direct break with Soviet doctrine.
- After World War II the Nationalist Party lost popular legitimacy through perceived corruption and nepotism; the Communist Party won the civil war in 1949 despite US backing of the Nationalists.
- Mao's Great Leap Forward (late 1950s) killed 30–45 million people in a famine caused partly by a culture of fear in which local officials reported false production targets upward rather than admit failure.
- The CCP's official post-Mao assessment: Mao was "70% right, 30% wrong" — the same ratio Mao himself applied to Stalin; Xi Jinping reframes this by saying the first 30 years (Mao) and the second 30 years (Deng) should not be used to criticize each other.
- Xi celebrates the Mao who fought the Korean War to a standstill against technologically superior Western forces, not the Mao who unleashed the Cultural Revolution.

## Future Trajectories for China

- Wasserstrom hoped China would return to the post-Tiananmen pattern of expanding civil society and tolerating internal diversity, but considers this hard to imagine under the current trajectory.
- Hong Kong represented something historically unprecedented: a city within a Communist-ruled country with a free press, independent courts, and legal protest — a space that no longer exists.
- Taiwan offers an example of a post-Leninist Chinese-majority society with competitive elections, press freedom, and democratic institutions — a different model of Chineseness.
- The concept of multiple cultural Chinesenesses — Taoist alongside Confucian, cosmopolitan alongside nationalist — is what the CCP under Xi is working to suppress in favor of a single authorized identity.
- Diaspora communities, overseas bookstores, and protest movements in Thailand and elsewhere sustain an alternative Chinese cultural tradition even as it is extinguished inside China proper.

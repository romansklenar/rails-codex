# Nick Lane: Origin of Life, Evolution, Aliens, Biology, and Consciousness | Lex Fridman Podcast #318

## Origin of Life in Hydrothermal Vents

- Nick Lane is a biochemist at University College London and author of Transformer: The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death and The Vital Question: Why Is Life the Way It Is?
- The leading candidate for life's origin is alkaline hydrothermal vents on the early ocean floor, which generate hydrogen gas in large quantities and produce electrical charges across cell-like pores.
- The fundamental chemistry of life is hydrogenation of CO2: hydrogen bubbling from the earth reacts with carbon dioxide, and the molecules produced in lab experiments are exactly the molecules found at the core of modern biochemistry.
- Mixing H2 and CO2 in a Falcon tube at 50°C with catalysts produces nothing, yet thermodynamically that gas mixture is less stable than cells — the barrier is kinetic, not thermodynamic, which is where the continuous electrical "spark" matters.
- Lane argues that oxygen made it impossible for life to originate again after it appeared in the atmosphere: hydrogen preferentially reacts with oxygen in an explosive reaction rather than with CO2, so no prebiotic chemistry can proceed.
- There is one universal last common ancestor for all life, but bacteria and archaea diverged extremely early — they share an identical genetic code and ribosomal translation machinery yet use completely different membrane lipids and different enzymes for DNA replication.
- The divergence of bacteria and archaea is consistent with one ancestor escaping a hydrothermal vent first, taking over the world, and then splitting rapidly into two lineages because membrane composition drove differences in DNA replication machinery.
- Lane considers life to begin when random RNA sequences are introduced into protocells that are already growing and dividing, because any sequence change that helps the cell replicate better is immediately subject to natural selection.
- If Earth were rerun a million times, Lane estimates a few hundred thousand runs would produce bacteria, because the chemistry from a wet rocky planet is strongly channeled toward the same molecules — but far fewer runs would reach eukaryotes or complex animals.

## Panspermia and the "Primordial Soup" Problem

- Lane rejects the primordial soup hypothesis: a dilute ocean of amino acids and nucleotides still requires an unexplained leap to become self-replicating, which he equates with invoking a miracle.
- Amino acids and nucleotides delivered by meteorites and comets are real and unequivocal, but they only stock a soup — they do not provide the continuous flow and structural organization that vents supply.
- Panspermia does not solve the origin-of-life problem; it only relocates it to another planet, while preventing the design of testable experiments that trace steps from sterile chemistry to living cells.
- A vent provides continuous self-organization from the start: carboxylic acids including fatty acids form spontaneously from CO2/H2 chemistry and self-assemble into bilayer membranes — soap-bubble-like structures — without any genes present.
- Lane argues that a "living planet" with interior-to-surface electron flow, tectonic turnover, and liquid water is more important than water alone; a puddle of water on a static planet does not indicate life is likely.

## Prokaryotes, Eukaryotes, and the Greatest Invention in Biology

- Lane considers the origin of the eukaryotic cell the single greatest invention in the history of life, larger in impact than photosynthesis, multicellularity, or the Cambrian explosion.
- Bacteria and archaea remained structurally simple for 2 billion years after the origin of life, even though bacteria have metagenomes larger than the human genome and have explored genetic sequence space far more thoroughly than eukaryotes.
- The eukaryotic cell arose ~2 billion years ago when an archaeal host engulfed a bacterial endosymbiont; this is the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria, and it has happened only once in the history of life.
- Human mitochondria retain only 37 genes — down from thousands in the original bacterial ancestor — making each mitochondrion a stripped-down power pack whose minimal genome costs almost nothing to maintain while still generating the cell's ATP.
- By retaining a tiny resident genome, mitochondria allow the nuclear genome to expand to ~20,000 genes and to be expressed at a rate roughly 100,000-fold greater per gene than is possible in bacteria operating under the same energy budget.
- The structural problem bacteria cannot solve is scaling up an electrically charged outer membrane: larger bacteria require extreme polyploidy (tens of thousands of genome copies) at enormous energetic cost, yet still cannot develop further complexity.
- Plants, animals, and fungi all share the same fundamental eukaryotic cell architecture despite radically different ways of life, which suggests the cell structure evolved in response to the internal challenge of hosting mitochondrial endosymbionts, not to external environments.

## Photosynthesis, Oxygen, and the Boring Billion

- Oxygenic photosynthesis — splitting water with sunlight to fix CO2, releasing O2 as waste — was invented only once, by cyanobacteria or their direct ancestors; no other bacterial lineage has independently achieved it.
- Photosynthesis that uses water as the hydrogen donor is chemically demanding because the charge separation required to split water must be wired so that electrons do not rush back and cause a localized explosion.
- Earlier forms of photosynthesis used hydrogen sulfide or ferrous iron as electron donors, but both produce solid waste (sulfur, rust) that buries the cell; oxygen is advantageous because it simply bubbles away.
- Oxygenic photosynthesis is the "single greatest planetary pollution event in Earth's history," transforming the atmosphere and making large active animals thermodynamically possible by providing an oxidant that yields ~40% energy extraction from food versus ~10% in anaerobic metabolism.
- After the Great Oxidation Event (~2.4 billion years ago), Earth entered the "Boring Billion" — roughly 1–1.5 billion years of global stasis where oxygen levels remained low and nothing much changed in biological complexity.
- Eukaryotes arose somewhere during the Boring Billion, but the bacteria themselves never changed: they are still bacteria, and that is a fact, not a failure of imagination.
- The Boring Billion ended with Snowball Earth glaciations and tectonic events that washed calcium sulfate into the oceans; sulfate-reducing bacteria then consumed organic carbon using sulfate as the electron acceptor, driving a carbon-isotope excursion that preceded the Cambrian explosion by roughly 10 million years.

## Sex, DNA, and Information Storage

- Eukaryotic sex evolved ~2 billion years ago alongside eukaryotes themselves; all eukaryotes share the same ground plan: haploid gametes fuse to form a diploid, chromosomes line up and recombine (meiosis), then two rounds of division produce new haploid gametes.
- Lane and PhD student Marco Colnaghi argue in PNAS that sex is forced on cells by genome size: as the genome scales from ~4,000 bacterial genes toward ~20,000 eukaryotic genes, random lateral gene transfer cannot reliably repair mutations because the probability of picking up the correct DNA from the environment falls too low — full chromosome alignment and recombination becomes necessary.
- Bacteria maintain genome quality through a metagenome — an E. coli cell has access to ~30,000 genes shared across the population — but this strategy cannot support individual cells with large genomes; E. coli has had 4 billion years and still cannot escape being a bacterium.
- RNA almost certainly preceded DNA in evolution; the ribosome is essentially a giant ribozyme (RNA enzyme), and the genetic code resides in RNA-amino acid interactions that are still visible in modern translation.
- The largest genomes that RNA can support are RNA viruses such as HIV, which are small; the chemical shift from RNA to DNA is minor but provides dramatically greater molecular stability, enabling arbitrarily large genomes.
- Lane suspects the 64-codon genetic code is not freely optimizable but is channeled by the thermodynamics of early CO2/H2 chemistry; his PhD student Stuart Harrison finds patterns in the code consistent with the first steps of biochemical CO2 fixation, suggesting life on Mars with similar chemistry might use a similar code.

## Predation, Violence, and the Cambrian Explosion

- Predation exists even in bacteria: Bdellovibrio uses a drill-like appendage to pierce another bacterium's membrane and replicates inside the periplasmic space, consuming the host cell.
- Before the Cambrian explosion, the Ediacaran fauna (~560–570 million years ago) were filter-feeding organisms found at depths greater than 200 meters — stalked, frond-like, sessile, with no visible shells, eyes, or claws; a gentle but limited world.
- The Cambrian explosion (~541 million years ago) marks the sudden appearance of eyes, claws, and shells in the fossil record and the beginning of true predator-prey arms races, driven in part by rising oxygen levels and the sulfate-induced carbon cycle perturbation.
- An oxygenated planet allows 5–6 trophic levels instead of 1–2 because aerobic respiration extracts ~40% of food energy; without oxygen, complex ecosystems with things eating things that eat other things are thermodynamically impossible.
- Evolution does not march steadily toward complexity; it locks into long stable states (billions of years of bacterial dominance, the Boring Billion) and only shifts with catastrophic planetary perturbations such as Snowball Earth, after which rapid change can produce an eye from a light-sensitive spot in roughly half a million years.
- Stephen Jay Gould's "punctuated equilibrium" captures a real pattern but is more striking at planetary timescale — the first 2 billion years was bacteria only, then a billion years of stasis, then sudden upheaval leading to animals — than in the animal fossil record alone.

## Consciousness and the Hard Problem

- Lane identifies consciousness as the biggest unsolved mystery in biology, not intelligence — he sees neural-network computation as understandable in principle, but cannot explain how a depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling.
- There are at least 40–50 formal definitions of life in the scientific literature, none of them satisfactory; the NASA working definition ("a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution") is immediately attacked on the word "self-sustaining" because the system is sustained by its environment.
- Lane wrote a chapter on consciousness in Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution and finds both main schools of thought unsatisfying: panpsychism (consciousness as a property of all matter) and emergentism (consciousness arising from neural complexity) each founder on the question of what a feeling is in biophysical terms.
- Lane proposes that feelings enter biology through real-time electrical feedback on cellular membranes: the membrane potential is a continuous signal of "how am I doing in relation to my environment," which can be selected over generations and complexified into emotions.
- Mitochondria in neurons have far greater total membrane area than the plasma membrane of the neuron itself and generate larger membrane potentials; their cristae in Drosophila brain cells form striking geometric patterns whose function is completely unknown, and Lane suspects they may contribute to consciousness-related electrical fields.
- Michael Levin's work on planarian flatworms shows that knocking out a single ion pump changes the electrical circuit enough to regenerate a head morphology resembling a species that diverged 150 million years ago, or even a head no one has ever seen — demonstrating that single gene changes can produce "hopeful monster" leaps in morphology.
- Yuval Noah Harari's argument that biochemistry is an algorithm — and therefore AI will be able to hack it and outperform humans at music and writing — is, Lane says, "close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable" as a biochemist to hear.
- Lane draws a distinction between intelligence (a form of computing he finds logically tractable) and consciousness (a property he believes is tied to life and its billion-year history of metabolic feedback), and suspects AI may never be conscious in the biological sense even if it becomes emotionally convincing.

## Fermi Paradox and Alien Life

- Lane expects tens of billions of planets in the Milky Way to host bacteria — roughly one per star system — because the chemistry of a wet rocky planet is strongly channeled toward the same molecules.
- He is deeply skeptical that complex multicellular life is common, because the eukaryotic cell arose only once in 4 billion years of Earth history, and without it, no plants, animals, or fungi would exist.
- The Fermi paradox resolution Lane finds most probable: intelligent civilizations simply do not exist in the right part of the universe at the right time, not because the universe is empty of life, but because the leap from bacteria to eukaryotes is a filter so severe that it rarely passes.
- If life were found on Mars with a slightly different genetic code, Lane notes this would be ambiguous: similar chemistry starting from the same CO2/H2 thermodynamics might inevitably produce a similar code, making independent origin and transit-from-Earth hard to distinguish.
- A definitive sign of independent Martian origin would be opposite stereochemistry — D versus L sugars or L versus D amino acids — because biology could use either mirror image but all Earth life uses the same chirality.
- Europa and Enceladus have liquid oceans with acidic chemistry similar to early Earth and almost certainly possess hydrothermal systems; Titan is more exotic, with liquid methane, and any life there would have to be chemically very different.
- Lane argues that AI cannot bootstrap itself from a sterile planet without organic life as an intermediary; intelligent designers are required to build AI, so any alien AI in the universe is necessarily the product of prior organic evolution.

## Human Evolution and the Role of Population Density

- The evolutionary distance from large complex mammals to humans is "not that long" — it is all about the brain — but rewind 5–6 million years and the chances of producing Homo sapiens specifically are not necessarily high.
- UCL anthropologist Mark Thomas's work shows that cultural complexity correlates better with population density and inter-group interaction rates than with specific inventions like fire, tools, or language.
- Isolated human groups, such as Easter Island, frequently lose complexity — skills disappear when the network of interactions that sustains them is severed — analogous to lateral gene transfer in bacteria.
- Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA diverged from modern human mtDNA approximately 600,000 years ago and shows no evidence of interbreeding (mtDNA is maternally inherited), while nuclear genome sequencing reveals extensive gene flow, suggesting one-way traffic of genes predominantly from Homo sapiens into Neanderthals.
- Lane suspects Homo sapiens drove Neanderthals to extinction at the margins of Europe through a combination of greater population density, aggression, and adaptability, without being able to specify the precise mechanism.
- Human nature contains both deep sociality and deep selfishness, and the tension between capitalism and communism is, Lane argues, simply a reflection of those two evolutionary imperatives both being genuinely embedded in our biology.

## Advice on Science, Writing, and Meaning

- Lane's only advice to PhD students is to follow what they are interested in; the people who survive the brutal competition of academic science are those who care enough to keep doing it regardless of career outcomes.
- Robert Louis Stevenson's observation that "nothing in life is so disenchanting as attainment" captures why happiness does not lie in prizes or promotions but in daily fulfillment of doing work that genuinely matters to you.
- Lane writes for himself at age 15–16 — someone hungry to reach the frontier of knowledge without excess jargon — and asks the childlike questions that experts often suppress for fear of appearing naive.
- The writing process is iterative: his editor told him after reading Transformer that the first two chapters "present a formidable hurdle to the general reader," Lane set the manuscript aside for two months, rewrote those chapters almost from scratch, and the editor then described the result as having "a barreling energy."
- Lane explicitly resists revising his earlier books, citing Darwin's multiple revisions of On the Origin of Species as a cautionary example where responding to criticism sometimes shifted the argument in the wrong direction.
- He sees the process of working out what to put in a scientific model as directly analogous to writing: both require finding the simplest unit that captures an idea clearly enough to see how it interacts with other ideas, and both are navigations through unknown terrain.

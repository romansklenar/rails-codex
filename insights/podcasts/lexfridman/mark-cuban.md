# Mark Cuban: Shark Tank, DEI & Wokeism Debate, Elon Musk, Politics & Drugs | Lex Fridman Podcast #422

## Entrepreneurship Fundamentals

- Cuban defines the three essential traits of a great entrepreneur as curiosity, agility, and the ability to sell — without sales, no business has ever survived.
- He started selling garbage bags door-to-door at age 12, framing selling not as persuasion but as helping: "Can my product help this person?" — and claims his close rate was near 100% because few people say no to a 12-year-old saving them time and money.
- Cuban describes his biggest intellectual skill as being able to drill down quickly to how any business makes money and then identify where a new entrant could improve productivity or profitability — a pattern he applies within seconds to any industry.
- His father worked as an upholsterer at Regency Products, lost an eye in a workplace accident, and took young Mark to sweep floors — not to teach him the trade, but to show him how backbreaking the work was so he would pursue college and avoid it.
- Cuban describes his early management style as more "yeller" than mentor — he had no patience for people who didn't keep pace, but later partnered deliberately with detail-oriented, perfectionist colleagues to balance his "ready-fire-aim" approach.
- He hated firing people because it felt like admitting a hiring mistake, and says he wanted to hire 99% of everyone he ever interviewed — so he delegated both hiring and firing decisions to partners better suited to those tasks.
- When asked what it takes to start a business, Cuban says someone who has to ask "what business should I start?" is not ready — genuine readiness means you already know the opportunity and are itching to pursue it.
- He advises people with obligations (mortgage, family) to save first and learn the industry deeply on evenings and weekends, quietly testing product-market fit before making any leap — not "Geronimo off a cliff."
- His father's summary of success: seeing his three sons go to college was his grand slam — and Cuban internalized from that the belief that time, not money, is the most valuable asset.

## How Mark Made His First Billion

- In late 1994 or early 1995, Cuban and co-founder Todd Wagner realized they could use the internet to listen to Indiana University basketball games in Dallas — previously they had used a speakerphone placed next to a radio in Bloomington, Indiana.
- They founded AudioNet, which Cuban describes as the first streaming content company on the internet, starting from the second bedroom of his house with a 128K ISDN line, a downloaded Netscape server, and progressive-loading audio files.
- Their initial setup was a $49 FM radio with two analog cables plugged into a server — they would encode the signal and post it at audionet.com, then promote the station on Uunet bulletin boards, CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL.
- AudioNet grew from 10 users per day to hundreds of thousands to a million over four years, entirely through word of mouth with zero advertising spend.
- Their real revenue came from corporate broadcasting: charging Intel $2 million and Motorola similar fees to stream product announcements to employees' PCs, replacing satellite-uplink-and-hotel-ballroom events that had cost companies millions of dollars.
- AudioNet rebranded to Broadcast.com in 1998, adding video and becoming the largest multimedia site on the internet by a wide margin — Cuban compares their lead to being "10X YouTube relative to competition."
- Broadcast.com went public in July 1998 with the largest first-day stock jump in the history of the stock market at the time; Yahoo invested $2 million just before the IPO.
- In April 1999, Yahoo agreed to acquire Broadcast.com; the deal closed in July 2000 for $5.7 billion in Yahoo stock — Cuban owned approximately 30% of the company.
- To protect his Yahoo stock, Cuban shorted an index containing Yahoo — the law at the time prohibited shorting any index where the target stock exceeded 5% of the index — and invested approximately $20 million in the hedge, which was later called one of the top ten trades of all time.
- He told CNBC's Joe Kernan at the time that he had collared the position; Kernan mocked him when Yahoo stock kept climbing, and Cuban replied: "Yeah, I feel real stupid sitting on my jet."
- Cuban attributes becoming a billionaire directly to luck — he could confidently rebuild a $10 million or perhaps $100 million business from scratch, but reaching $1 billion required the timing of the internet bubble, which he could not have predicted or controlled.
- He describes the dot-com bubble as identifiable because companies with just a website were going public with no intrinsic value or path to operating profit — which he does not see in the 2024 AI market, noting the absence of any IPO pipeline for AI companies.

## Shark Tank and Investing

- Cuban has done Shark Tank for 15 years primarily because it is the only show where every minute celebrates the American Dream — children from Ketchum, Idaho or Dubuque, Iowa appear and inspire kids watching who realize "if they can do it, I can do it."
- He describes receiving emails from adults who say they started businesses because they watched Shark Tank as five- or ten-year-olds.
- His investment in a 19-year-old from Pittsburgh named Laney with a simple sugar scrub: he did not expect it to become a $100 million business, just a $2–5 million business that would pay her bills — six months after airing she called to say she had $1 million in the bank.
- His biggest missed deal was Spikeball — a backyard net-and-ball game now popular on beaches nationwide — which he passed on because he did not want to serve as commissioner of a new Spikeball league.
- He declined to invest in Uber at a valuation of $10–15 million after Travis Kalanick pitched him the idea, telling Travis the biggest challenge would be fighting taxi commissions and that the budget allocated to marketing was insufficient for that battle — Kalanick never came back.
- Cuban told Kalanick: "The best thing about you is you'll run through walls and break down barriers. The bad thing about you is you'll run through walls even if you don't have to."
- For valuation, Cuban uses a simple rule: a business valued at $1 million must generate $100,000 in after-tax distributable cash flow to return a 10% stake — and asks whether the founder can achieve that, or whether he and his team can do it for them.
- Barbara Corcoran is, in his view, the best evaluator of founders on Shark Tank — she can hear someone talk for 20 minutes and know whether they can do the work.

## DEI Debate

- Cuban's definition of DEI: Diversity means expanding your applicant pool to candidates you would not otherwise have found; Equity means putting a new hire in a position to succeed; Inclusion means giving that person the support to feel confident and comfortable doing their job.
- He argues that legal quotas are not part of DEI in corporate America — they would be illegal in most contexts — and calls the quota framing a "straw man" deployed by critics.
- He acknowledges that reverse discrimination against white and Asian employees does occur in practice because "there's no human being that is 100% objective," but believes discrimination against people of color is far more prevalent and that reverse discrimination is being overstated as a trend.
- When Cuban asked both Bill Ackman and conservative critics who was forcing them to implement DEI ideology in their companies, none could name a specific entity that compelled them — he concludes that the threat of "woke ideology" is primarily a social-media amplified narrative rather than a lived corporate reality.
- He distinguishes sharply between DEI in companies, which he defends, and DEI in universities, which he considers expensive and poorly implemented — noting that tuition has grown at a multiple of inflation partly due to administrative bloat including DEI spending.
- He opposed the Harvard and UNC affirmative action ruling, arguing that diverse student bodies produce graduates better prepared for the real world, while acknowledging it is not his institution to run.
- On the Elon Musk tweet calling the "woke mind virus" fundamentally axiomatic, Cuban responded publicly: "The fundamental axiomatic flaw of the anti-woke mind is that it allows groups with historical power to play the victim by taking anecdotal examples and packaging them into conjured conspiratorial ideology that threatens to upend the power structures they have been depending on."
- His position on Dylan Mulvaney and gender transition: he doubts there is data showing that a TikTok creator with ~250,000 followers at the time of the Bud Light campaign caused measurable increases in youth transition rates — and notes the most recent JAMA data from 2021 to 2022 showed transition numbers going down.
- He supports a minimum age of 18 for gender-transition surgery absent parental consent and doctor approval, but argues that the claim that every professional in the process — doctors, psychologists, hospitals, insurers — is systemically corrupted by trend is implausible.

## Politics: Trump, Biden, and Immigration

- Cuban states he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden were on his deathbed, and his core reason is personnel management: Biden's cabinet has had essentially zero turnover and no former officials have turned on him and written exposés — the opposite of Trump's record.
- He cites Trump's mentor Roy Cohn as the origin of Trump's "deny, deny, deny" approach, saying Trump has internalized Cohn's playbook almost entirely.
- He calls Biden's handling of the southern border a "horrific mistake" and believes Obama-era deportation rates show Democrats are capable of border enforcement — he thinks Biden misjudged how much immigration slack existed after COVID without factoring in fiscal and political consequences.
- Cuban dismisses the theory that Democrats are allowing illegal immigration to manufacture voters as "insane," pointing out that illegal immigrants cannot register to vote and that voter ID laws in red and purple states create robust verification regardless.
- He attributes the lack of bipartisan political leadership to the absence of any prominent figure willing to publicly call out their own party's failures: no one says "Republicans, that's hyperbole" and "Democrats, you screwed up on immigration."
- His warning on algorithmic control: "The person who controls the algorithm controls the world" — relying on one platform or its affiliated outlets as a singular source of information means whoever programs that algorithm controls your perception of reality.
- He recommends creating a burner Twitter account and checking who the algorithm recommends unprompted — arguing it systematically surfaces accounts Elon Musk engages with positively, most of which are right-leaning.

## Drugs and Big Pharma

- The core problem in American healthcare, in Cuban's diagnosis, is the complete absence of price transparency — and lack of transparency produces lack of trust, which constitutes a broken system.
- Cost Plus Drugs (costplusdrugs.com) shows users three numbers for each of its 2,500+ medications: what the company actually paid for it, a flat 15% markup, and a pharmacy fill fee plus shipping — that is the total price with no hidden rebates or variable pricing.
- Research comparing Cost Plus Drugs pricing to CMS negotiated prices found Cost Plus Drugs cheaper than even what the federal government negotiates for Medicare.
- The three dominant pharmacy benefit managers — CVS Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts, and United Health's Optum Rx — require NDAs from clients preventing disclosure of pricing terms, enabling them to charge different companies vastly different prices for identical drugs with no way to comparison shop.
- Humira, the top-revenue drug in the US, costs ~$8,000/month at list price; after rebates, clients of the big PBMs pay $3,000–6,000/month; Cost Plus Drugs sells Yusimry, a biosimilar, for $594/month — but the big three PBMs exclude Yusimry from their formularies because they receive no rebate on it.
- Cuban discovered that his Dallas Mavericks had paid a big-three PBM $169,000 for a set of generic drugs that would have cost $19,000 through Cost Plus Drugs — the discrepancy was invisible until he obtained his own claims data.
- He was paying an employee benefits consultant $30 per employee per month — worth millions annually — and discovered that consultant was steering him to companies paying the highest commissions rather than offering the best plans.
- He argues that healthcare is most companies' second-largest expense after payroll, yet virtually no CEO understands how that money is spent — and recommends large companies (500+ employees) hire a dedicated internal healthcare CEO.
- Community pharmacies are being driven out of business because PBMs reimburse them below their cost of acquiring Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drugs — a pharmacy buys a $600 drug for $570, receives a $20 copay from the patient, but gets reimbursed only ~$500 by the PBM, creating a guaranteed loss on nearly every Medicare script.
- He co-founded Cost Plus Drugs with Dr. Alex Oshmyancy, a radiologist and physicist who initially proposed a compounding pharmacy for generic drug shortages — Cuban reframed it as a much larger transparency play, inspired partly by Martin Shkreli's 7,500% price increase on Daraprim, which exposed how inefficient and opaque the market was.
- He puts his own name on Cost Plus Drugs — the only company he has ever done so — specifically to use his public profile as leverage against an entrenched cartel, noting that a 25-year-old starting out would more rationally build inside the system and sell to incumbents.

## AI

- Cuban supports open-sourcing AI models as a smart business decision but opposes mandating it — he frames it as analogous to early internet companies sharing technology at conferences while still competing.
- He predicts there will eventually be millions of AI models rather than four or five dominant foundation models, comparing the trajectory to the shift from captive mainframe software (DEC, IBM) to off-the-shelf PC software.
- His argument against centralized medical AI: the Mayo Clinic and MD Anderson are massive brands built on proprietary expertise — contributing that intellectual property into a single shared model like ChatGPT or Gemini would be "business suicide," so he expects them to build and license their own models.
- He is an "AI optimist, not an AI fatalist" and dismisses Vinod Khosla's Manhattan Project comparison for open-source AI, while acknowledging that military applications of AI are legitimately scary.
- He is actively building a meta-search layer across 30 different AI models so users can compare outputs side by side — useful, he notes, for contested questions like "Is DEI good?" where different models will produce different answers.

## Advice for Young People

- His core advice: be curious, read voraciously, expose yourself to as many different ideas and domains as possible — because you cannot know in advance what will click.
- He took one technology class in college (Fortran), cheated on it, and did not fall in love with programming until he got a job at Mellon Bank learning a scripting language called Ramus — which then led him to sell software and found MicroSolutions.
- He believes every single human being on earth has something they could be world-class at — the hard part is finding it, which requires curiosity and sometimes access to resources that not everyone has equally.
- In 1992 he traveled to Moscow State University to teach students how to start businesses, finding that Russian students literally did not know the word "profit" — yet entrepreneurship exploded across the former Soviet Union immediately after the USSR fell, which he interprets as evidence that the drive is natural and only suppressed by systems.
- When he speaks to elementary school children, he points to objects in the room — a light, a chair — and says: "One day that didn't exist. Somebody had the idea. Why not you?" — and makes the kids repeat aloud: "Why not me?"
- He defines success personally as "waking up every day with a smile, excited about the day," adding: "If you were happy when you were broke, you're going to be really, really, really happy when you're rich" — money amplifies who you already are rather than changing it.

# Andrew Callaghan: Channel 5, Gonzo, QAnon, O-Block, Politics & Alex Jones | Lex Fridman Podcast #425

A gonzo documentarian who grew up managing depersonalization disorder through journalism explains why empathy without agenda is the only lens that captures America's edges honestly.

## Early Life and the Origins of Journalism

- Callaghan's first journalism assignment in 9th grade, written for teacher Calvin Shaw at his alternative high school in Seattle, was titled "Inside the Deep Web: A Conversation with a Hitman" — he messaged a Hidden Wiki hitman via Tor browser and published the story under his own name.
- Shaw let Callaghan leave school to conduct street interviews as long as he returned by end of day with a story — effectively granting him a four-year field journalism apprenticeship.
- In 8th grade, Callaghan took an eighth of senescence mushrooms and woke up the next morning with permanent visual snow, floaters, and morphing objects — a lifelong condition called hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD); the only clinically recognized treatments are alcohol and benzodiazepines.
- Callaghan began drinking 40-ounce Mickey's malt liquor every day after school at age 14 or 15 specifically because alcohol suppresses HPPD's visual symptoms; the leading researcher is Dr. Abraham in Upstate New York.
- Callaghan identifies his extreme-environment journalism as a coping mechanism for derealization: being on camera and reviewing the MP4 file afterward serves as confirmation that he is physically present in reality.

## Hitchhiking and the Road

- After his first year at Loyola University in New Orleans, Callaghan left all his belongings in the dorm, bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to Baton Rouge, and hitchhiked back to Seattle over 70 days with no money; his primary research text was "Vagabonding in America" by post-WWII hobo writer Ed Buryn.
- Movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre effectively destroyed US hitchhiking culture by making drivers fear murder — collapsing a system that Mexican day laborers, who routinely hitchhiked to work themselves, still participated in naturally.
- The overwhelming majority of people who picked Callaghan up were Mexican day laborers who would drive out of their way to take him exactly where he needed to go; Christian families with Jesus-fish bumper stickers were most likely to throw full Dr. Pepper cans or yell "Go to hell, hippie."
- People on the margins — seasonal workers, those struggling with addiction — were consistently more generous than conventionally "respectable" drivers, which Callaghan attributes to shared recognition of visible struggle.
- He chronicled the journey in a self-published book, "All Gas No Brakes: A Hitchhiker's Diary," which sold out its final hundred copies about six weeks before this episode recorded.

## Quarter Confessions and New Orleans

- Working as a host at Bourbon House — a fine-dining restaurant at the corner of Bourbon and Iberville — Callaghan was required by management to keep his eyes on tables even while naked men masturbated in full view through the floor-to-ceiling windows.
- Quarter Confessions — a Taxi Cab Confessions spin-off — went viral on Instagram immediately with a format of asking drunk Bourbon Street revelers for their deepest secret; New Orleans' 22% homicide solve rate made people unusually forthcoming, including a 15-year-old who confessed to executing a man who had molested his sister, then asked Callaghan to tag him so he could go viral.
- The iconic oversized gray suits Callaghan wears on camera came from Goodwill, typically costing $12–$25, inspired aesthetically by Ron Burgundy and Eric Andre.
- Callaghan eventually grew uncomfortable with the ambush format: subjects filmed drunk would appear in vastly different social contexts digitally, and many regretted participating — prompting him to seek more intentional journalism.
- Doing Things Media CEO Reid contacted him one week after his May 2019 graduation with an offer: an RV, $45,000 per year, gas, food, and two hotel nights per week to produce content — which became All Gas No Brakes.

## Burning Man and the Birth of All Gas No Brakes

- All Gas No Brakes launched September 2019 with a concept of asking people for their craziest psychedelic trip story; Burning Man attendees — predominantly Silicon Valley tech workers — were too guarded for street ambush, so Callaghan announced on Burning Man Radio that "psychedelic journalists" were parked at Tan and I, attracting 10 pre-vetted interviewees to their 1998 Catalina Coachman Sport RV within two hours.
- A man Callaghan calls DJ Soft Baby — allegedly connected to Harvard or MIT — put chowder on his face while dancing in a golden leotard; within 24 hours the clip caused Doing Things Media's entire Instagram network to be taken down, held hostage until Callaghan agreed to never repost it.
- After Burning Man, the show traveled to Talladega Race Weekend, a Donald Trump Jr. book signing, and the Sausage Castle — a Central Florida fetish mansion described as "juggalo adjacent" (ICP fans on the FBI gang list, rooted in Warren, Michigan, with a significant Pacific Northwest prison presence).
- The show pivoted to political content when Covid hit: anti-lockdown Freedom Rallies at the California State Capitol in Sacramento became Callaghan's most successful video to that point.
- Callaghan was fired along with his two crew members from Doing Things Media in a frozen RV in a South Philadelphia Walmart parking lot after requesting a 50% profit split — the company had signed him to a 360 deal entitling them to 100% of any outside income.

## The George Floyd Protests and Transition to Serious Journalism

- When the third Minneapolis precinct burned following George Floyd's murder, Callaghan flew on his personal card without consulting his boss, arriving the second night of riots as National Guardsmen were photographing IDs at the airport and announcing over the PA that nobody was permitted to leave.
- A college friend named Lacey drove him to Lake Street — Kmart and Target burning — handed him a Sony A7 camera, and told him to approach a man holding a Molotov cocktail and ask "What's on your mind?"; the man's answer: "Everything that was happening here was supposed to happen. This is how we feel. Is it right? No. But this is how we feel."
- The only other news organization interviewing protesters on Lake Street was Unicorn Riot; local TV stations filmed the fires from five blocks away without engaging subjects.
- An anarchist was stopped from firebombing White Castle by a community member who said "We fuck with White Castle" — the restaurant survived while every surrounding business burned; earlier, a group that had cracked open an ATM together immediately began fighting each other for the cash as it sprayed out.
- Callaghan was shot in the ass by a National Guard rubber bullet; the Minneapolis video became the pivotal moment where he transitioned from comedic ambush interviewer to political journalist.

## This Place Rules — The HBO Documentary

- The film was originally titled "America Shits Itself"; it was produced by A24 and Tim and Eric's Abso Lutely Productions and executive produced by Jonah Hill — who also provided his lawyers to eventually free Callaghan from the Doing Things Media 360 deal — with Tim and Eric making contact via Instagram DM while Callaghan was at the UFO Mega Conference in Laughlin, Nevada.
- Callaghan pitched the premise before the 2020 election: if Trump won, major cities would burn; if Trump lost, his supporters would attempt a coup — he filmed from October 2020 through April 2021.
- The film opens with "Joker Gang" (Miami Cuban street character Joker 305) and "Gum Gang" fighting as a microcosm of partisan polarization, then returns to Joker Gang at the end as an unexpected voice of wisdom.
- The QAnon family profiled in the film, the Spencers, went from apolitical to having their entire lives consumed by Q mythology within four months of Stop the Steal beginning in September 2020; the Spencer son's deepest hurt was that January 6th failed and his father had been led astray.
- Enrique Tarrio, former Proud Boys chairman (sentenced to 23 years in prison), told Callaghan two weeks after January 6th that he did not believe the election was stolen and was relieved he hadn't been at the Capitol.
- The retrospective director's chair narration bridging the documentary was editor Clay's idea, working out of Abso Lutely's office.

## Alex Jones, CNN, and the Press Tour

- Alex Jones is identical on and off camera; his Infowars studio is MSNBC-level in production quality; he warned Callaghan before filming that including him would cause serious backlash — which proved accurate.
- HBO mandated media training with 15 approved lines for defending the platforming decision, including "sunlight is the best disinfectant"; Callaghan ignored all of them.
- On CNN's Don Lemon morning show, Callaghan told Lemon on air: "You're directly antagonizing and stirring people up against half the country because you need money to support a dying platform" — CNN never posted the segment online.
- Time Warner owns both CNN and HBO; the confrontation caused Callaghan's entire press tour — including all scheduled late-night show appearances — to be canceled.
- At an NPR premiere in Boston, a journalist wearing two N95 masks opened the Q&A by asking how Sandy Hook families would feel about Callaghan platforming Alex Jones; he countered that Noah Posner's father Leonard — represented by lawyer Mark Bankston — was a fan of the film.

## QAnon and Political Polarization

- QAnon's specific mythology has faded but its ideas have been absorbed into mainstream conservative politics; Callaghan theorizes it may have functioned as a psyop to redirect people approaching genuine class consciousness toward lizard-people mythology and away from the bipartisan corporate apparatus.
- The "Stop the Steal" narrative hurt the pride of ordinary believers more than it harmed elites: Trump distanced himself from the Capitol breach the following day while supporters faced federal prosecution; Enrique Tarrio privately told Callaghan the election was not stolen.
- Callaghan believes a second January 6th is extremely unlikely — Americans are too comfortable with Sonic, AMC theaters, and 7-Eleven; actual insurrection requires the economic desperation of an Arab Spring, where protesters successfully took governments, not just a building.
- Both Fox News and CNN follow the same economic logic — generating fear and division to sell advertising — which Callaghan describes as a manufactured 50-50 polarization that keeps the underlying power structure permanently intact.

## Sexual Misconduct Controversy and Recovery

- Eight minutes before the HBO documentary's 8 PM Pacific premiere on December 30, 2022, Callaghan received a text requesting money for therapy bills; he later learned a civil lawsuit in the millions was being prepared using his response as evidence.
- A conflict from 2021 — where a fan told him she felt she had consented under pressure and accepted his apology — was revived at maximum leverage on launch day by a third party who mass-messaged Callaghan's production partners without the original person's full authorization.
- Callaghan's entire support network — friends, agents, production contacts — disappeared within one week; during this period he logically concluded his death would reduce harm to those he loved, and was deterred only by knowing the grief would shorten his mother's life.
- He attributes the pattern of behavior across multiple accounts to using Instagram as a de facto dating app on the road and being oblivious to how power dynamics changed as his audience grew.
- His advice to men with any platform: be hyper-aware of inherited power dynamics; have trauma-informed conversations with new partners about their history before any physical encounter; do not assume verbal consent given under unclear social pressure is genuine.
- Two weeks after the controversy peaked he met a partner he is still with, and describes conquering his two biggest fears — monogamy and dogs — as a direct result of the crisis.

## Channel 5 and Journalistic Philosophy

- Channel 5 originated as a deception tactic during All Gas No Brakes: telling aggressive subjects "this is Channel 5" caused them to self-censor; Callaghan and his team own channel5.com and channel5.news because no one had registered a name so obvious it seemed already taken.
- His interview selection method is entirely passive: he looks for people with open body language and verbal readiness; someone with pain in their eyes qualifies; a shy person does not get approached.
- Channel 5 editing style — crash zooms (artificial zoom in Adobe Premiere), punchy sound cuts, added silence for comic timing, inspired partly by Vic Berger — has been pulled back as Callaghan pursues more serious credibility.
- His Vegas Tunnels documentary was taken down by an illegal DMCA strike from Gray Media (a conglomerate controlling TV stations in most small American markets) using 10 seconds of publicly broadcast news footage; Callaghan spent $70,000 on production including $20,000 in multilingual voiceovers and is suing to set fair-use precedent for documentary filmmakers.
- His shift toward solution-oriented journalism came after a recovery specialist explained that helping homeless people get IDs changes nothing without first addressing the underlying shame cycle — and that the specialist had been trying to do what Callaghan attempted in one week for the previous 10 years.
- He is developing a series on endangered American languages: 150 US languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers, including Hawaiian Sign Language (15 remaining) and Gullah Geechee on the South Carolina Sea Islands, threatened by golf course development.

## Drill Rap, O Block, and Street Culture

- Drill music originated around 2010 in Chicago — Callaghan credits King Louie and Waka Flocka Flame's "Flockaveli" as primary influences alongside Chief Keef, who emerged from O Block in the Englewood neighborhood on Chicago's South Side.
- Drill's defining characteristic is a "true crime component" — fans demand verification that artists rapping about violence have actually committed it, which Callaghan describes as treating gang members as superheroes from outside the affected communities.
- Drill spread from Chicago to UK to New York (particularly the Bronx and Brooklyn) and is now sufficiently distributed that Callaghan estimates there is a drill rapper every 10 square miles.
- O Block is a housing project in Englewood near where Michelle Obama grew up; rapper Lil Durk, connected to O Block through his artist King Von, faces potential RICO exposure related to the alleged assassination of FBG Duck in Chicago's Gold Coast.
- When Callaghan filmed there, O Block residents had collectively converted to Islam and were posting morning prayer content on Instagram under captions like "Put the guns down, let's pray" — he read this as a deliberate image rehabilitation effort.
- Crip Mac (real name Trevor) — currently incarcerated for a probation violation (firearm possession) — joined the Crips after his mother, living in Houston with her new partner (a police officer called Mr. Gary), sent him on a one-way Greyhound to Los Angeles when she discovered Mr. Gary being sexually penetrated by a coworker.
- Callaghan feels safer on camera with gang-affiliated subjects like Crip Mac than with random pedestrians, attributing it to the clarity of known social codes versus unknown civilian intentions.

## Human Nature and the Role of Listening

- Callaghan believes most people are good and think they are acting for the common good — including the most politically divided — but differ radically in what means they believe will achieve a just society.
- He distinguishes goodness from courage: most people, when tested, choose self-interest; his personal support network's complete collapse during the controversy confirmed this.
- His prescription for healing political division: listening without preconceptions, not forced mediation, not mandated education — "keep your ears and your heart open to people you don't know and your life will change."
- After 5+ years of documenting people at the edges of American life, his core conclusion is that journalists and audiences alike should humanize rather than tokenize subjects — "these are people with lives and concerns and dreams just like you."

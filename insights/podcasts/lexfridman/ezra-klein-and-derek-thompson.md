# Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson: Left vs Right Politics, Trump, Elon & DOGE | Lex Fridman Podcast #462

A four-hour conversation structured around Klein and Thompson's book Abundance, which argues that liberalism's core failure is a shift from building things to blocking them — and that solving the supply-side of housing and clean energy is the path to political renewal for the left.

## Defining Left vs Right

- Klein: the left's core premise is that life is fundamentally unfair — luck of birth into family, country, and circumstance — and government's role is to convert that unfairness into universal dignity, not perfect equality.
- Klein distinguishes between the "government of the check" (left's domain: welfare, healthcare) and the "government of the gun" (right's domain: military, surveillance, police).
- Thompson: liberals fear injustice, conservatives fear cultural radicalism; liberals tolerate overreach, conservatives tolerate inequality — these archetypal differences underlie policy disagreements.
- The "small government" framing of the right is largely rhetorical: government grew under Reagan, defense expanded, and the Iraq War required enormous state capacity and faith in government.
- Klein: markets are enforced by government — the left vs right debate is about how market rules are structured, not whether government is present.

## The Democratic Party's Leadership Vacuum

- After the 2024 loss, the Democratic Party has no presumptive next leader — no equivalent of the post-2000 Al Gore or post-2016 Biden/Sanders dynamic.
- Democrats control no branch of federal government: not the presidency, Senate, House, or Supreme Court.
- Schumer and Jeffries publicly disagreed over whether to vote for the continuing resolution, revealing the absence of unified strategy even at the leadership level.
- Klein notes the Democratic Party has never been as internally fragmented in his lifetime; he expects the 2026 midterms and a subsequent primary to produce new voices.
- Senate Republicans confirmed Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Tulsi Gabbard, and RFK Jr. against their own preferences, illustrating Trump's total dominance of the right's top-down structure.

## Political Realignment and the Neoliberal Order's Collapse

- Historian Gary Gerstle's concept of "political orders": the New Deal order (FDR, entrenched by Eisenhower) gave way to the neoliberal order (Reagan, entrenched by Clinton's "era of big government is over").
- The neoliberal order collapsed under three pressures: the 2008 financial crisis (botched stimulus, slow recovery), climate change (markets made pollution profitable), and China's rise (integration failed to liberalize Beijing; instead, it built an industrial rival).
- Bernie Sanders winning a near-majority in the 2016 Democratic primary would have been "unthinkable" in 2004 — a marker of how fast the old order dissolved.
- Trump ran against trade, immigration liberalization, and the Iraq War — exploiting the right's internal failure on all three neoliberal commitments.
- Neither side has found a new consensus; both parties are in flux, and Klein argues this is why platforms like Lex Fridman's are hard to "code" as left or right — audiences are genuinely unsettled.

## The Abundance Thesis and Supply-Side Progressivism

- Thompson coined the "abundance agenda" in 2022 after standing outside in 21-degree weather waiting for a COVID test two years into the pandemic — a symbol of manufactured scarcity.
- The book's core claim: America needs to "build and invent more of the things it needs" — housing and clean energy are the two primary targets.
- Thompson: liberalism shifted from the politics of building (FDR highways, New Deal infrastructure) to the politics of blocking over the past 50 years.
- California authorized over $30 billion for high-speed rail that "basically doesn't exist"; Chicago spent $11 billion building 10,000 affordable housing units at $1.1 million per unit; San Francisco built a public toilet for $1.7 million.
- Biden's administration authorized $42 billion for rural broadband and $7.5 billion for EV chargers — practically none was built by the time of the episode.
- Klein: "We are trapped between a party that wants government to fail and a party that won't make government work."

## Housing as the Central Crisis

- Housing is described as "the theory of everything" in policy: it connects innovation (city density), childcare costs (building costs), mobility, and intergenerational opportunity.
- A 10% increase in progressive vote share in a city correlates with a 30% decline in housing permits, per research cited by Thompson from The Atlantic's Yoni Applebaum.
- California's permitted housing supply has trended steadily downward for 40 years — a deliberate policy outcome, not a geographic or technological constraint.
- The San Francisco board of supervisors blocked a 500-unit apartment building (including 100 below-market units) on a Nordstrom parking lot — the month after Newsom signed a law ending single-family zoning — because developers missed environmental review paperwork.
- Klein: cities are the economic frontier; a barber near Google earns far more than a barber in rural Arkansas, and closing cities to non-wealthy residents closes the traditional American mobility escalator.
- Raj Chetty's research shows children innovate in the field of the place they grow up near — gating cities from lower-income residents compounds over generations.
- Klein's "gentry law" concept (from David Schleicher): American property law shifted in the back half of the 20th century toward protecting current owners over enabling new construction.

## Redistribution vs Supply: Not a Trade-off

- Klein argues redistribution and supply expansion are "peanut butter and chocolate" — but only if you address supply; housing vouchers without new supply produce "cost-disease socialism" (Niskanen Center term), driving prices up.
- Operation Warp Speed is cited as the model: publicly funded mRNA research (DARPA decades earlier), fast regulatory clearance, free distribution — redistribution and supply-side unlocking working together.
- Single-payer healthcare without supply expansion would immediately crash into doctor and nurse shortages — residency rules, nursing scope-of-practice laws, and immigration restrictions all constrain healthcare supply.
- Pell Grants and higher-ed subsidies without supply-side reform allowed colleges to pocket subsidies and build gyms rather than expand student slots.
- Thompson's "Equinox liberalism" metaphor: citizens in Sweden and Denmark pay high taxes but see what they're getting; American liberalism charges Equinox prices and delivers a "shit-ass gym."

## Regulation, Process vs Outcomes, and "Everything Bagel Liberalism"

- Klein distinguishes between deregulating the private sector and deregulating the government itself — the latter is underappreciated even on the left.
- LA's Measure HHH: a $1 billion+ affordable housing bond produced a few thousand units at $600,000–$700,000 each — more than market-rate homes in Denver — because public money triggers layers of union labor, green building codes, disability reviews, and subcontractor preference rules.
- NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) was designed to stop industrial pollution; it is now routinely weaponized to block housing, clean energy, and transit construction through infinite litigation.
- Thompson's principle: the solutions of one era become the problems of the next — 1970s environmental rules that cleaned air and water now block solar farms and dense housing that would address climate change.
- Ezra's "everything bagel liberalism": each additional social goal attached to a housing project (prevailing wage, green standards, disability review, veteran preference, minority subcontractor rules) is individually defensible but collectively makes the project unbuildable.
- Mancur Olson's "Rise and Decline of Nations" argument: stable, affluent societies over time develop powerful lobbying organizations that entrench complexity; America selected for lawyers, finance, and management consultants rather than engineers because bargaining, not building, became the path to agency.

## DOGE, Elon Musk, and the Logic of Destruction

- Thompson's steelman for DOGE: government is genuinely inefficient at achieving its own goals, and a department focused on efficiency is legitimately needed — even liberals should be "obsessed with making government work."
- Klein's deeper steelman: DOGE was never about efficiency — it was about deletion; the only way to make radical change possible in an entrenched bureaucracy is to destroy what exists, then rebuild it as a responsive instrument of the president.
- The Project 2025 / Russ Vought theory: the administrative state is a "metastatic" accretion around the executive branch that prevents the democratically elected president from governing; firing and traumatizing the civil service restores democratic accountability.
- Klein: what Elon did at Twitter was not make it more efficient — he made it controllable; the federal government operation mirrors that: break oppositional power, then redirect the institution.
- Elon's threat to spend $50–$100 million in any Republican primary against a senator who defies Trump created a "death star" that cowed even reluctant Republicans into confirming RFK Jr., Hegseth, and others.
- The FDA example: DOGE cut probationary employees at the FDA; because the FDA's bottleneck is understaffing on phase-3 clinical trial approvals, this makes drug approval slower, not faster — an example of destruction without goals.
- Klein: PEPFAR — a George W. Bush program that saved a generation from HIV/AIDS and was considered among the most cost-effective foreign aid programs ever — was simply "turned off" without any efficiency review.
- The first Trump term was inhibited by Jared Kushner (brought in Gary Cohn, mainstream figures, tension); the second term has Donald Trump Jr. (accelerators, not inhibitors), Elon Musk (believes Trump doesn't go far enough), and a cowed Congress.

## Sam Harris, the Overton Window, and Cognitive Risk from AI

- Klein and Sam Harris clashed around 2018 over Charles Murray and race and IQ; Klein says he was "not angling for a fight" and offered multiple de-escalation attempts that Harris declined.
- Klein credits Harris with not sliding into conspiracy (unlike the Weinstein brothers) and remaining critical of Trump even when it was politically costly on his side of the intellectual dark web.
- Klein's concern on cognitive risk: the Flynn effect — rising IQ scores driven by the "scientific spectacles" society taught people to wear — may now be reversing; literacy scores and test scores are declining.
- Social media and AI automate the most cognitively valuable activities: reading deeply, writing first drafts, making novel cross-domain connections — the parts most likely to sharpen intelligence.
- Klein: "We spend a lot of time talking about how to get smarter and not enough time talking about how to avoid getting dumber."
- Klein prints all reading material rather than reading on screens because his attention is qualitatively different — even with identical content.

## Future of America: Optimism and High-Variance Uncertainty

- Thompson: GLP-1 drugs (synthesized from lizard venom for type-2 diabetes) show anti-inflammatory effects that may partially treat dementia and Alzheimer's — an accidental breakthrough demonstrating the value of funding "weird science."
- Thompson: mRNA cancer vaccines, CAR T-cell therapy, and AI-assisted combinatorial drug discovery may produce a "golden age" in biomedical science in the coming decades.
- Klein frames the current moment as high-variance, more like the early 20th century than the stable 1990s — possibilities range from catastrophe to extraordinary flourishing.
- Klein's personal hopes include cultivated meat (eliminating factory farming), mass desalination enabled by energy abundance, and AI that genuinely accelerates scientific discovery rather than replacing human reasoning.
- Both agree that institutions — not technology alone — determine outcomes; discoveries happen inside institutions, and how those institutions are funded and incentivized determines what gets built.

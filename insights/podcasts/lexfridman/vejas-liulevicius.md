# Vejas Liulevicius: Communism, Marxism, Nazism, Stalin, Mao, and Hitler | Lex Fridman Podcast #444

A University of Tennessee historian who grew up visiting Soviet Lithuania takes Lex Fridman through the full arc of communist ideology — from Marx's internal contradictions to Putin's war — grounding abstract ideas in specific mechanisms of terror and collapse.

## Marx's Core Ideas and Internal Contradictions

- Marx claimed history has a predetermined direction — a "science of revolution" — while simultaneously assigning heroic roles to exceptional individuals who can give history "an extra push."
- He adapted Hegel's dialectical idealism into dialectical materialism: history moves through class conflict toward an inevitable communist endpoint.
- Engels eulogized Marx as "the Darwin of history," claiming he had discovered hidden laws governing human society the way Darwin discovered evolution.
- Marx's stages ran: primitive communism → state slavery → private slavery → feudalism → capitalism → proletarian revolution → communism.
- His prediction of "immiseration" (verehlendung) — that the working class would grow ever poorer, triggering revolution — was already failing in his lifetime as middle classes expanded and unions won reforms.
- Marx promised the state would "wither away" after revolution, while also endorsing "despotic inroads against property" as a necessary transitional phase — a contradiction he left deliberately vague.
- Germany — industrialized, centrally located — was Marx's expected site of revolution; the fact it happened in pre-industrial Russia was recognized by Lenin himself as a gamble, not the fulfillment of the plan.
- The German Social Democratic Party was the largest party in the Reichstag by 1912, raising the possibility of socialism through elections — itself a contradiction of Marx's insistence on revolutionary rupture.
- Communism became one of the strongest traditions in history despite being founded on the imperative to break with all traditions — what Liulevicius calls a "tradition of radical rupture."

## Marx, Engels, and Bakunin: The Intellectual Arena

- Engels — son of an industrialist — financially supported both himself and the Marx family for decades; without this patronage, Marx's lasting impact is doubtful.
- Marx impregnated the family maid and did not accept responsibility for the child, a biographical fact at odds with his rhetoric of collective liberation.
- Before the Bolshevik seizure of power, to be a serious radical socialist required reading German: Marx, Kautsky, Bernstein — Russian became the prestige language only after 1917.
- Mikhail Bakunin, Marx's chief rival, warned that a movement fighting hierarchies while using hierarchical organization would reproduce authoritarianism; Marx had him expelled from the First International.
- Every alliance between anarchists and communists — Russian Revolution, Civil War, Spanish Civil War — ended with communists liquidating their anarchist allies, who were structurally unable to match Leninist party discipline.
- Scholars including Reinhold Niebuhr (1930s Atlantic essay) and Eric Voegelin identified communism as a "political religion" — promising what earlier ages understood in religious terms: salvation, apocalypse, heaven on earth.
- The Soviet Museum of Atheism in a repurposed Vilnius church contained almost no exhibits — revealing the ideological hollowness of official atheism; Lenin's mummified body at Red Square functioned as a communist relic.

## Lenin and the Bolshevik Seizure of Power

- Lenin was in Swiss exile in early 1917 despairing he might not live to see revolution; months later he was seizing power in Petrograd after WWI created the necessary power vacuum.
- The German High Command negotiated Lenin's sealed-train return to Russia, believing Bolshevik agitation would knock Russia out of WWI — a decision they later deeply regretted.
- Lenin consciously avoided beautiful music like Beethoven because it made him feel gentle; hardness was a deliberate political and personal virtue.
- Lenin's model for post-revolutionary administration was Swiss post offices: orderly, procedural, not requiring visionary leadership — a naïve projection he never got to test.
- The expected chain reaction of revolution in Germany never materialized; German socialist government crushed the communist Spartacist uprising in 1919 using nationalist mercenaries, creating a wound in the German left that never healed.
- Lenin signed the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany — surrendering vast territories — without reading it, confident it would be a dead letter once global revolution broke out.

## Stalin: Rise, Character, and Methods

- Stalin rose not through charisma — his voice was squeaky, his Russian Georgian-accented, his face pockmarked — but through control of Bolshevik personnel decisions while Trotsky delivered speeches.
- Contemporaries experienced Stalin as a moderate conciliator; his brutality was entirely invisible until he held absolute power, making him a model of the "wolf in moderate clothing."
- Lenin promoted Stalin as dependable and committed, despite private reservations about his rudeness toward colleagues; Lenin's failure to name a clear successor enabled the succession struggle.
- The Cheka (secret police) was established immediately after the Bolshevik seizure of power, headed by Polish aristocrat Feliks Dzierzynski ("Iron Felix"), around whom a cult of the humane-but-ruthless executioner was constructed.
- Stalin's own writing stated that a strong, active, intelligent person who does condemned things is still a good person — a formulation resembling Machiavelli's The Prince, which Stalin reportedly read extensively.
- Stalin's ideology and personal power-seeking were likely not alternatives but mutually reinforcing: the ideology gave him the master plan; the power gave him the instrument to execute it.

## The Holodomor and Collectivization

- Collectivization aimed to put farming on a factory model, eliminating the independent peasant and making agricultural output predictable and state-controlled — driven by ideological contempt for agriculture as inherently pre-modern.
- Successful farmers (kulaks) were denounced as exploiters and dispossessed, systematically eliminating the most entrepreneurial and self-disciplined agricultural population — the pattern Liulevicius calls "negative selection."
- The 1932–33 famine was entirely man-made: food quotas were extracted at gunpoint, areas were cordoned off, and starving people were prevented from leaving.
- Statistical falsification pervaded the system bottom-up: everyone in the chain of command doctored reports to avoid punishment, so central planners operated on a "foundation of sand."
- The Soviet Union was still importing grain from the West at the end of its existence — collectivization never solved the agricultural productivity problem it was designed to fix.
- The joke "We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us" captured the structural collapse of incentives that collectivization produced across the entire Soviet agricultural economy.

## The Great Terror (1936–38)

- Stalin set execution quotas for provincial secret police organs, which competed to overachieve quotas — generating an ever-expanding list of accused traitors through forced confessions naming new suspects.
- The terror targeted old Bolsheviks (potential rival power centers), intelligentsia, military officers, and random citizens caught in the quota machinery.
- Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago documents dedicated communists in the Gulag who were certain that if Stalin only knew of the mistake, it would be corrected — unable to believe the system itself was the source.
- Orlando Figes's The Whisperers traces multiple families through the Stalin period, documenting how entire networks of people were destroyed and survivors could not speak of losses in public for decades.
- The pattern of "negative selection" — repeatedly winnowing the most talented, entrepreneurial, and independent — left lasting cultural damage Liulevicius argues persists in Russia to the present day.

## Nazism, Fascism, and Totalitarianism

- Fascism originated with socialist Benito Mussolini, fusing national glorification, state supremacy, and permanent military mobilization into a rejection of liberal democracy and individual rights.
- The Nazi label "National Socialist" was deliberately chosen to confuse — fusing vocabulary from across the political spectrum to claim transcendence of prior divisions; Goebbels initially stressed the "socialist" component.
- Nazis viewed Bolshevism as a "Judeo-Bolshevik" racial conspiracy; Soviets viewed Nazism as the "last desperate gasp of capitalism" — each cosmology made the other's ideology incomprehensible as an independent force.
- Despite being ideological arch-enemies, Nazis and Communists cooperated in Weimar Germany to make democracy unworkable, then formalized cooperation in the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 23, 1939.
- Hannah Arendt's concept of totalitarianism described not achieved total control but the unprecedented ambition to exercise thoroughgoing control over entire populations — new in human history, not a revival of ancient barbarism.
- The Nazi Generalplan Ost envisioned mega-highways to Crimea for Germanic vacationers and scientifically distributed agricultural colonies across Ukraine — drafted in detail even as the Eastern Front was being lost.
- Hitler and Himmler planned permanent war on the Eastern Front with no intended peace treaty — moving the border east every generation to give successive German soldiers combat experience.
- Himmler's formulation that surviving Slavs would serve as "slaves for our culture" was the explicit long-term plan for Eastern Europe had the invasion succeeded.

## Refuting Cooper/Carlson Revisionism on WWII

- The claim Churchill was "the chief villain of WWII" who forced Hitler to expand beyond Poland ignores Nazi geopolitics, which explicitly aimed at world domination — not a limited regional conflict.
- The argument that the Holocaust was an unintended accident of war is contradicted by Operation Tannenberg: Nazi Einsatzgruppen targeting Polish leaders and Jews began immediately upon the 1939 invasion — before Operation Barbarossa.
- Interpreting Hitler as a "traditional Bismarckian politician" only works by excluding his ideology — an enterprise Liulevicius calls "doomed to failure and justifiably so."
- The claim that the war's outcome was the worst possible ignores Nazi atomic weapons without restraint, permanent enslavement of Slavic peoples, and ongoing generational war across Eastern Europe.

## Mao, the Great Leap Forward, and China after Mao

- Mao's foundational revision placed the peasantry — not the industrial proletariat — in the revolutionary vanguard; Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski said Maoism was so divergent one "hardly knows what to do with it."
- Mao explicitly competed with Stalin: the Great Leap Forward (1958–62) was designed to outpace Soviet industrialization and achieve full communism before the USSR.
- The Great Leap Forward killed approximately 40 million people through famine caused by: forced collectivization into massive communes, Lysenkoist pseudo-science (planting at non-germinating depths for "super plants"), campaigns to exterminate birds and insects, and labor diverted to backyard steel smelters.
- Mao promised full communism by 1961 or 1973; after his death in 1976 the CCP revised this to 2000 — unfulfilled promises that eroded regime legitimacy in ways parallel to the Soviet experience.
- The Hundred Flowers Campaign (1956–57) — whether cynically designed to identify critics or a genuine miscalculation — ended identically: mass punishment of the most intellectually venturesome, another episode of negative selection.
- In 1981 the CCP declared Mao "70% correct" — a formulaic precision that foreclosed repudiation of the founder while acknowledging disaster; Xi Jinping has since re-elevated Mao's stature.
- Deng Xiaoping's post-1978 reforms released entrepreneurial energies suppressed under Mao, raising the question of whether China is still meaningfully communist — a question Liulevicius says haunts China's current leadership.

## Russia after the Soviet Union and the Ukraine War

- The Soviet collapse produced no Nuremberg-style reckoning — no legal proceedings, no systematic public accounting of responsibility; initial historical openness quickly gave way to present-focused politics.
- Putin rehabilitated the Tsars as heroes of Russian statehood, viewed Lenin negatively (his federalist model planted the "time bomb" that exploded the USSR), and treated Stalin as effective despite his costs.
- Putin's 2022 invasion expectation — that significant portions of Ukrainians would welcome Russian forces — was entirely overturned by unified Ukrainian resistance, driven in part by a new generation with no Soviet nostalgia.
- Ratifying the use of force to change European borders — a taboo since 1945 — sets incentives for further territorial aggression regardless of how any ceasefire is structured.
- Liulevicius is pessimistic about peace negotiations because accumulated suffering eliminates the compromises that sound reasonable to people far from the conflict; ceasefire terms could lay the foundation for a worse war within a decade.

## Lessons for Understanding Ideology and Leadership

- The appeal of communism rested on the prestige of science in the 19th–20th centuries: a doctrine claiming scientific inevitability for human liberation is maximally intoxicating to intellectuals who want to be on the right side of history.
- Communist revolutionary elites systematically were not members of the working classes they claimed to represent — a gap that recurred across Russia, China, Vietnam, and Cuba, shaping the distance between ideology and practice.
- The concept of Erwartungshorizont (horizon of expectation) — what a leader believes the future holds, shaped by their formative experience — is the most useful analytical lens for understanding political behavior.
- Liulevicius's single piece of advice to young people: read full books, not summaries — the slow process of thinking within an author's categories builds the empathy and analytical resistance to manipulation that no summary can replicate.

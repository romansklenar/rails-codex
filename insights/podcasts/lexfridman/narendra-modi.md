# Narendra Modi: Prime Minister of India - Power, Democracy, War & Peace | Lex Fridman Podcast #460

The first sitting Indian Prime Minister to appear on a Western podcast, Modi frames his entire career — from Himalayan wanderer to three-time election winner — through the single lens of service as a spiritual practice.

## Fasting as Spiritual Discipline

- Modi has fasted for 50–55 years following Ayurvedic preparation: five to seven days of cleansing practices before any extended fast begins.
- During Chaturmas (mid-June to after Diwali, roughly four to four and a half months), he eats only one meal per 24 hours.
- During both Navratris he fasts completely on hot water only for nine consecutive days while continuing full head-of-state duties.
- During Chaitra Navratri he eats a single type of fruit once per day for nine days — if he chooses papaya, only papaya for all nine days.
- At a White House bilateral dinner with President Obama he was served a glass of hot water; he told Obama "my dinner has arrived" as a joke, and Obama remembered it at their next meeting.
- Modi argues fasting is not deprivation but a scientific process that sharpens all five senses — the aroma of water itself becomes perceptible — and accelerates thinking.
- His first fast was as a schoolboy joining a Gandhian cow-protection movement; at that age he felt no hunger, only a surge of energy and new awareness.

## Childhood in Vadnagar and Early Formation

- Born in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Gujarat, in a single room with a mud floor and no window, shared by his entire joint family.
- His family had never worn shoes; poverty felt normal because there was no comparison point.
- After his uncle bought him white canvas shoes (~10–12 rupees), he collected chalk discarded by teachers, mixed it into paste, and polished the shoes white every evening.
- His father left home at 4:00–4:30 AM every morning to visit temples before opening his tea stall; villagers could tell the time by the sound of his leather footsteps.
- His mother treated sick children from the neighborhood with traditional Ayurvedic remedies before sunrise every day, instilling in Modi a practice of service.
- Vadnagar has been continuously inhabited for 2,800 years; archaeological excavations Modi commissioned as Chief Minister confirmed evidence of Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu co-existence and attracted the Chinese monk Hiuen Tsang centuries ago.

## Journey in the Himalayas and Spiritual Search

- At approximately 17 Modi left home and spent roughly two years wandering the Himalayas, living nomadically, bathing in cold mountain streams, and sleeping in the open to test his physical limits.
- He formed a deep bond with Swami Atmasthananda of the Ramakrishna Mission, who lived nearly 100 years; Atmasthananda told him his purpose was societal service, not personal enlightenment.
- A story from Swami Vivekananda's life — sitting before Goddess Kali three times yet unable to ask for anything for himself — lodged in Modi as the paradigm of giving over receiving.
- During his Himalayan wandering he encountered a sage who taught concentration by placing a leaf to drip water rhythmically onto a bowl; Modi meditated on that sound for hours, which he describes as the foundation of his meditation practice.
- He describes the inner man — the Himalayan wanderer, the boy caring for sick children, the Prime Minister — as identical, bound by the same spiritual commitment regardless of the outer role.
- He frames himself not as Prime Minister but as "prime servant," saying power itself has never interested him; he entered politics to produce results, not to accumulate influence.

## RSS and Hindu Nationalism

- Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a child, drawn initially by the patriotic songs of a traveling performer named Makoshi who played a tambourine.
- The RSS is approaching its 100th anniversary and operates through millions of volunteers with no government funding; Modi calls it probably the largest volunteer organization in the world.
- RSS-inspired organization Seva Bharati runs approximately 125,000 social service projects in slum communities without government assistance.
- Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, another RSS-linked body, operates over 70,000 single-teacher schools in tribal regions, partly funded by small diaspora donations from the United States.
- Vidya Bharati runs nearly 25,000 schools educating around 3 million students at very low cost with an emphasis on values alongside academics.
- The RSS-affiliated Indian Labour Union has about 50,000 unions with millions of members; its slogan — "Workers unite the world" rather than the leftist "Workers of the world unite" — represents, in Modi's framing, an ideological inversion from conflict to contribution.

## The Idea of India and Indian Civilization

- India's unity is cultural rather than administrative: over 100 languages, thousands of dialects, different cuisines and clothing every 20 miles, yet the name Ram appears in some form across every region — Rambhai in Gujarat, Ramachandra in Tamil Nadu, Rambhau in Maharashtra.
- A daily Hindu bathing ritual involves chanting the names of all major rivers — Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, Sindhu, Kaveri — binding citizens to the entire subcontinent symbolically.
- Shankaracharya established four pilgrimage sites at the four cardinal directions; millions still travel between them, and water is carried from Rameshwaram to Kashi and back, functioning as a living cultural internet.
- Western and global models read nations as administrative units; India's unity pre-existed and survived many fragmented administrative systems because it rested on pilgrimage, shared mythology, and cultural ritual.
- Modi draws a distinction between "nation" and "civilization": India is the latter, continuous for thousands of years regardless of which ruler held administrative control.

## Mahatma Gandhi and Geopolitical Philosophy

- Modi admires Gandhi for transforming every ordinary person — a sweeper, a weaver, a caretaker of lepers — into a conscious soldier in the independence movement rather than reserving the struggle for elites.
- Gandhi's Dandi March salt protest succeeded because the British could not grasp how a pinch of salt could trigger mass revolution; Modi sees this as proof that symbolic acts aligned with cultural memory have outsized political force.
- At a London Gujarati newspaper event Modi offered the analogy of the fly versus the bee: a fly spreads filth, a bee collects nectar but whose sting forces you to hide your face for three days — he called on journalism to have the bee's power of sting alongside its sweetness.
- Modi's stated foreign policy doctrine from 2013: India will "neither look down on anyone, nor look up to anyone — it will see eye to eye." This principle has governed his approach to the US, China, Russia, and Pakistan.
- He proposed three global frameworks at multilateral forums: "One Sun, One World, One Grid" for solar energy via the International Solar Alliance; "One Health" encompassing humans and flora and fauna; and "One Earth, One Family, One Future" as the G20 2023 motto.

## Russia-Ukraine War and India-Pakistan

- Modi says he told Putin directly "this is not the time for war" and told Zelensky that no matter how many allies stand with Ukraine, resolution cannot come on the battlefield — both parties must reach a negotiating table.
- His position: "I am not neutral. I stand with peace." He explicitly distinguishes this from neutrality.
- On Pakistan: after partition in 1947, trains filled with bodies arrived immediately; Modi argues that rather than ideology, Pakistan has adopted state-sponsored terrorism as an instrument of policy — a trail he says leads back to Pakistan in virtually every major global attack including 9/11 (Osama bin Laden sheltered there).
- His first diplomatic gesture as Prime Minister was inviting all SAARC heads of state, including Pakistan's leader, to his swearing-in ceremony — a gesture former President Pranab Mukherjee described as historic in his memoir.
- He visited Lahore personally in pursuit of peace; every initiative was followed by a hostile incident.
- India and China together once accounted for more than 50% of global GDP; Modi sees the 21st century as Asia's century and wants healthy competition, not conflict, with China.
- The 2020 border clashes created a five-year rupture in India-China relations; after Modi's recent meeting with Xi Jinping, border conditions are being restored to pre-2020 norms.

## 2002 Gujarat Riots and Governance Under Pressure

- Modi became Chief Minister of Gujarat on October 7, 2001 — eight to ten months after the Kandahar hijacking (December 1999), the Red Fort attack (2000), 9/11 (September 2001), and the Kashmir Assembly attack (October 2001), all creating extreme communal tension.
- The Godhra train burning on February 27, 2002 occurred just three days after Modi first entered the Gujarat Assembly as a newly elected representative — he had never previously held elected office.
- Before 2002, Gujarat had over 250 significant communal riots; the 1969 riots alone lasted nearly six months.
- India's Supreme Court twice — in 2012 and 2022 — upheld that Modi had no involvement in the 2002 violence.
- In the 22 years since 2002, Gujarat has had no major communal riot; Modi attributes this to shifting from "appeasement politics" to "aspiration politics" under the mantra "development for all, trust from all, efforts by everyone."
- He distinguishes "criticism" from "allegations": genuine criticism requires deep research and identification of real weaknesses; allegations skip that work and only create conflict.

## Indian Democracy: Scale and Logistics

- In the 2024 general election, 980 million voters were registered — twice the population of North America and larger than the entire EU — with 646 million casting ballots despite temperatures exceeding 40°C.
- India has more than one million polling booths, 2,500 registered political parties, 900 round-the-clock news channels, and more than 5,000 daily newspapers.
- Election results are announced within a single day despite the scale; some countries take months.
- No voter is permitted to be more than two kilometers from a polling booth; helicopters transport booths to remote areas, and a single-voter polling station was set up in the Gir Forest of Gujarat for one solitary voter.
- Arunachal Pradesh hosts the world's highest-altitude polling booth on record.
- Modi eliminated 100 million ghost or duplicate names from welfare rolls after becoming Prime Minister in 2014; direct benefit transfer through technology then saved nearly 3 trillion rupees that would otherwise have leaked.
- He removed 40,000 unnecessary regulatory compliances and repealed approximately 1,500 outdated laws; the GeM (Government e-Marketplace) portal increased competition and reduced costs in government procurement.

## Relationship with Trump, Musk, and the US

- At the Houston "Howdy Modi" event (2019), Trump sat in the audience while Modi spoke from the stage, then agreed without hesitation to walk a lap of the stadium with Modi — surprising his own Secret Service detail.
- After Trump's first term ended, Trump told mutual acquaintances "Modi is my friend, convey my regards" dozens of times over four years without direct contact, which Modi describes as a rare form of loyalty.
- Modi sees Trump and himself as aligned by the same national-first philosophy: Trump's "America First" mirrors Modi's "India First."
- Modi describes Trump in his second term as "far more prepared" with a clear roadmap compared to his first term, and views the DOGE efficiency project as parallel to his own 2014 governance reform.
- Modi has known Elon Musk since his time as Chief Minister; at the Washington meetings Musk attended with his family, creating an informal atmosphere alongside Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, and JD Vance.

## AI, Technology, and Indian Talent

- Modi's argument at the Paris AI Summit: AI trained without Indian data will always "write with the right hand" — it will systematically misrepresent the billion-plus left-handed experience of Indian civilization.
- India rolled out 5G faster than any country in the world once it started, overturning external perceptions of being behind.
- After Modi opened the space sector to private companies a couple of years ago, 200 startups are now active in space technology.
- India's Chandrayaan lunar mission cost less than a single Hollywood blockbuster film.
- An American executive told Modi that advertising for engineers in the US fills a single room; the same ad in India overflows a football field.
- Modi distinguishes information from knowledge: information is raw data, knowledge is what emerges through processing, reflection, and understanding over time.
- Ramanujan attributed his mathematical insights to the goddess he worshipped; Modi uses this as evidence that science and spirituality are complementary rather than opposed.

## Decision-Making, Hard Work, and Philosophy of Leadership

- Before taking office Modi had stayed overnight in 85–90% of India's districts as part of party organizational work, giving him ground-level knowledge unavailable from briefing documents.
- His decision yardstick: "Will this harm my nation? And will this help the poorest person?" — the second question drawn directly from Gandhi's stated heuristic.
- During COVID he ignored pressure from Nobel-winning economists to flood the economy with money; by holding to fundamentals India avoided the severe post-COVID inflation that hit most of the world.
- He made approximately 40 personal phone calls per day during COVID lockdown to party volunteers aged 70 and above, checking on their health — a practice that simultaneously gave him grassroots intelligence.
- Three promises made to citizens in 2014 and maintained for 24 years: never fall behind in hard work, never act with bad intentions, never do anything for personal gain.
- On loneliness: he uses a "one plus one" philosophy — Modi plus the Almighty — meaning he considers himself never alone; the Himalayan years built the capacity for self-sufficiency.
- On death: he argues death is the only certainty in life, therefore there is no rational basis for fearing it; instead, commit energy to living fully before it arrives.
- Pariksha Pe Charcha, his annual public interaction with students, addresses exam stress by reframing purpose: exams test one domain but cannot measure total potential, and the student mindset — always learning — should never be retired.

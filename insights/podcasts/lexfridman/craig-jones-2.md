# Craig Jones: Jiu Jitsu, $2 Million Prize, CJI, ADCC, Ukraine & Trolling | Lex Fridman Podcast #439

Craig Jones uses irreverent humor as both a public persona and a strategic instrument — most visibly in founding CJI, a free-streaming, charity-benefiting tournament designed to embarrass ADCC's paywall model and stagnant prize money.

## The $1 Million in Cash on Joe Rogan

- Craig brought a literal $1 million in cash to the Joe Rogan Experience to prove CJI's prize money was real; the cash was provided by a friend of sponsor shuffle.com who drove it to Rogan's studio without security, at Rogan's insistence Craig accepted Rogan's own security detail.
- Craig sent photos of the cash to everyone he knew before the appearance, describing it retrospectively as a probable security risk.
- Rogan claimed he had never seen $1 million in cash before; Craig expressed skepticism about this.
- Craig's stated philosophy on risk: he is attracted to adventure and treats risk as an acceptable byproduct rather than the goal itself.

## Kazakhstan: Kok Boru and Cultural Friction

- Craig filmed content in Kazakhstan for a travel documentary series called "Craig Jones Gone Walkabout," modeled on Anthony Bourdain's approach to revealing both the appealing and uncomfortable aspects of a place.
- He participated in Kok boru, an ancient Central Asian game using a headless goat carcass as a ball, with riders on trained horses competing for cash prizes from local business owners; Craig's drunk stuntman took him directly into the active game instead of ending the shot at the boundary.
- Kazakh riders in the pit pointed at Craig shouting "Borat," associating his presence with Sacha Baron Cohen's film, which Craig describes as "a very traumatic memory" for Kazakhs; the Borat comparison shut down several planned filming segments.
- The experience confirmed his view that honest cultural observation from an outsider position requires earning trust the Bourdain did — Craig found Bourdain's ability to critique places without alienating locals genuinely difficult to replicate.

## Ukraine: Front-Line Visits and the Reality of Modern War

- Craig visited Ukraine twice: first in roughly March or April 2024, reaching 0.7 km from the front line after organizing what became the largest jiu-jitsu seminar in Ukrainian history, with ticket profits donated to soldiers.
- A Ukrainian soldier Craig befriended offered access with the line "I can't promise you'll survive, but I'll promise you'll have a good time"; Craig accepted.
- On the first trip in Kyiv, a hypersonic missile shot down by the Patriot air defense system landed approximately five minutes from his hotel, shaking the entire building; Craig took a piece of missile shrapnel home in his luggage.
- Craig and a companion visited Chernobyl through a connection made via the charity seminar; they passed four security checkpoints over two attempts, nearly arrested on the first, and got a private tour of the entirely uninhabited exclusion zone.
- On the second trip, Craig traveled with Ukraine's national police chief escort to Kherson, where population has dropped from 250,000 to roughly 50,000 — almost entirely military — because Russia controls territory directly across the Dnipro River less than one kilometer away.
- In Kherson, a blast less than half a kilometer from Craig's position killed at least one person and wounded several while he was mid-tour in an armored vehicle; the driver used a building for cover and raced back to the police station after radio confirmation.
- Craig and a Ukrainian special forces soldier also shot RPGs at a Lada painted with the ADCC logo as a CJI marketing stunt at a shooting range; ricochet bullets passed close enough to Craig that one landed near his leg.
- Soldiers told Craig that if he had been shot they would have had to dump his body at a hospital with no explanation — the incident remained undisclosed.

## FPV Drones as the Defining Technology of the War

- Ukraine has become the world leader in budget FPV drone technology, using carbon-fiber, 3D-printed drones costing $300–$500 to destroy $3 million Russian tanks.
- Weaponized payloads include grenades, mines, and a liquid capable of burning through armor to kill crew inside.
- The police chief gifted Craig one of the operational drones and summarized the tactical shift: "Artillery is scary, but a drone will follow you into a building."
- Drones can loiter indefinitely, waiting for targets to emerge; footage of them chasing soldiers through buildings and into rubble circulates on Ukrainian Telegram channels.
- One Ukrainian battalion extended FPV drone range to 30–40 km by mounting an FPV drone beneath a larger carrier drone with a signal booster.
- Lex and Craig discussed the near-future risk of autonomous drone swarms on both sides eliminating human oversight entirely, with civilian casualties as an inevitable consequence.

## Ukrainian Soldier Morale and the Politics of Weapons Supply

- Soldiers Craig spoke to universally expected a prolonged war; front-line movement at some sectors is measured in 200 meters over six months.
- Radio intercepts of Russian soldiers marching to known Ukrainian positions — aware they will die — struck Craig as a World War II-style human-wave tactic.
- During Craig's first visit, the US had not yet approved the weapons resupply package; soldiers remained outwardly optimistic but were acutely aware of Patriot missile stockpile depletion.
- Ukrainian soldiers buy their own high-quality personal equipment — boots, cold-weather gear, armor inserts — because government supply covers only basics; some grow social media followings specifically to solicit donations for their battalions.
- Craig's friend Roman had lived in France for eight years, had a wife and daughter there, and voluntarily returned to Ukraine to protect his mother and brother; Craig describes this as a category of obligation hard to comprehend from an Australian or American perspective.
- Another contact, Dmytro, took up an AK-47 with a bicycle helmet at the invasion's start, citing his grandfather's execution by the USSR in documents he carries: "I'd rather be dead than live under Russian rule again."

## CJI: Origin, Structure, and the Athlete Pay Argument

- CJI originated when ADCC's operator Mo challenged Craig online to "go get $2 million and put on your own tournament" after Craig complained that ADCC had not raised prize money despite a sold-out 10,000-person crowd in 2022 and significant FloGrappling streaming revenue.
- An anonymous investor provided a $3 million budget specifically to fund the trolling of ADCC and grow the sport; he asked only to remain anonymous and to enjoy the chaos.
- CJI is structured as a nonprofit: all ticket revenue goes to charity, primarily Tap Cancer Out, with matching contributions from Rich Byrne (KASAI founder and cancer survivor) and a second anonymous donor dollar-for-dollar.
- CJI pays every competitor $10,001 to show up — more than ADCC's $10,000 first-place prize — plus $1 million to each division winner with no prize for second place, creating pure all-or-nothing incentives.
- The event broadcasts live and free on YouTube, X, and Meta rather than behind a paywall; Craig explicitly compares the strategy to Andrew Schulz and Mark Normand releasing comedy specials for free to build audience before monetizing.
- The rectangular "Alley" fighting surface — inspired by Karate Combat's angled-wall pit — was built to eliminate referee resets (a major ADCC annoyance) while keeping viewing sightlines clear by elevating surrounding seating into a coliseum configuration.
- Rounds structure is three five-minute rounds in qualifying, five five-minute rounds in the final, with aggressive stalling penalties — borrowed from MMA's 10-point-must scoring logic to appeal to mainstream audiences.
- CJI booked Thomas & Mack Center (ADCC's original 2022 venue, cost approximately $200,000) for the same weekend as ADCC's T-Mobile Arena ($2 million); Craig argues the venue cost increase consumed money that should have gone to athletes.
- Craig claims ADCC began offering undisclosed "show money" to retain athletes only after CJI started recruiting them, and that ADCC raised women's prize money to equal men's immediately after Ffion Davies (reigning women's champion) joined CJI.

## Athlete Recruitment, Ruotolos, and the Mica Galvao Decision

- The Ruotolo brothers (Kade and Tye) joined CJI despite allegedly being offered show money by ADCC to stay, on the condition they be placed on opposite bracket sides so they could meet in the final.
- Mica Galvao declined CJI in favor of pursuing the youngest-ever double Grand Slam (winning all major Gi events and ADCC in the same year); Craig argues that supporting athlete pay would have been a more historically significant legacy choice.
- Galvao's decision was also complicated by teammates competing in the ADCC junior division and his coaching staff not wanting to split focus between two simultaneous events.
- Nicholas Meregali replaced Craig on the New Wave/Danaher team after Craig's departure; they faced each other at ADCC 2022 (99 kg division, Craig winning by decision) and a planned rematch fell apart when Meregali chose vacation over a booked post-ADCC event.
- Craig says he would require at least $500,000 to rebook the Meregali match, framing the money as payment for giving Meregali the psychological satisfaction of erasing the prior loss.
- Gordon Ryan did not enter CJI; Craig and Ryan do not have an active communication channel, and Craig suggests MDMA-assisted couples therapy as a path to reconciliation.

## Gabi Garcia Super Fight and the CJI Wager

- Gabi Garcia stands approximately 6'3"–6'4" and competes at 220–275 lbs; Craig weighs 179 lbs at 5'11", representing roughly a 90+ lb size differential.
- The match wager: if Garcia wins, Craig pays her $1 million personally; if Craig footlocks her, they collaborate on an OnlyFans video — Garcia shook on it.
- Craig framed the matchup as three years of online "seduction" culminating in a competitive confrontation, and described it as motivational for anyone who has persistently DM'd someone on Instagram.
- Craig plans to take the match completely seriously despite the comedic framing and is open to future rematches, including an MMA format.

## Training Philosophy and Technique Development

- Craig's core training advice for beginners: prioritize longevity by selecting safe training partners, staying relaxed in bad positions, and training at a pace slow enough to understand what just happened rather than survive it.
- Panic is the primary cause of fatigue in grappling; remaining calm in disadvantaged positions is itself a high-level skill that signals confidence in one's defensive capability.
- Craig's personal optimal training volume is two hard rounds per session — enough to simulate competition intensity without accumulating the toll of longer sessions; he explicitly avoids six-minute multiple-round training blocks.
- Gunnar Nelson reportedly achieved a bronze medal at an ADCC absolute division after spending the previous night drinking, unaware he was scheduled to compete; Craig cites this as evidence that psychological relaxation can outperform exhaustive preparation.
- Craig claims to have popularized (not invented) certain leg-lock entries, the octopus guard, and turtle-based pinning games; financial incentives from instructional sales drove his motivation to develop and publicize novel techniques.
- He describes innovation in jiu-jitsu as "reverse engineering" positions where opponents don't know what's happening — creating panic through positional unfamiliarity rather than through athletic dominance.

## Volkanovski, Dagestani Wrestling, and Cross-Discipline Analysis

- Craig served as a grappling consultant for Alexander Volkanovski, training at a small beach-city gym in Australia built on puzzle mats — an environment Craig contrasts with the expectation that a UFC featherweight GOAT candidate trains at American Top Team.
- Volkanovski's pre-fight switch from total relaxation to "you're never taking this belt from my family" — referencing his children as motivation — is the specific psychological transformation Craig finds most striking.
- Craig believes Volkanovski has a strength and cage-wrestling advantage over Islam Makhachev that was not fully exploited in either fight, and thinks Volk's best path was attempting takedowns rather than staying upright.
- A planned Volkanovski vs. Mikey Musumeci grappling super fight at CJI failed to come together for reasons Craig would not disclose.
- Dagestani wrestlers' all-pressure, never-concede-an-inch training style is optimal for MMA against the cage but creates vulnerability in pure grappling — they fall into leg lock traps by being too forward-aggressive or fail to manage guard positions from the ground.
- The buggy choke, Craig insists, can catch anyone including Khabib Nurmagomedov — though Khabib would refuse to tap and simply go to sleep.

## Steroids, Trolling, and What Gives Hope

- Craig's stated position on PEDs: everyone who has beaten him has taken "more steroids than me"; he considers the actual prevalence in grappling impossible to determine since athletes do not disclose and testing is minimal.
- His OnlyFans account (featuring jiu-jitsu content) is the only paywalled element of CJI; he jokingly describes its projected post-Gabi-match revenue as capable of funding the entire tournament.
- Craig choked out Alex Jones on camera, was briefly concerned Jones might have died given his high blood pressure, and found himself laughing uncontrollably the whole time.
- Craig defines trolling as requiring a worthy adversary — someone with a large enough profile that engaging them is not punching down — and rates Chael Sonnen above himself because Sonnen taunted opponents who could physically harm him in return.
- The Australian cultural baseline for "banter" is sufficiently extreme that Craig describes moving to America as entering a world where people take themselves seriously enough to be easy targets.
- What gives Craig hope: "That you can still make fun of anything — as long as it's funny." He frames cancel culture as a failure of craft rather than a failure of permissiveness.

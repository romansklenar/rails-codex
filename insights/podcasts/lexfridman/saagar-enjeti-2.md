# Saagar Enjeti: Trump, MAGA, DOGE, Obama, FDR, JFK, History & Politics | Lex Fridman Podcast #454

A deeply book-driven political analysis that uses presidential history as a lens to explain every major fault line in contemporary American politics.

## Why Trump Won in 2024

- A global wave of anti-incumbent energy in 2024 hit ruling parties in every major democracy for the first time since at least World War II, per a Financial Times analysis.
- Biden's age, unpopularity, and a 25% cumulative rise in grocery prices were the most direct proxies for the vote shift — inflation is the single highest determinant of vote-switching.
- Trump's 2024 win makes him the most consequential American political figure since FDR; an 18-year-old voter in 2028 will have no political memory that predates Trump.
- Trump won households earning under $100,000 while Harris won households over $100,000 — a divide that tracks education level more than income.
- Trump won Latino men and dramatically narrowed margins with Black men, making him one of the most racially depolarizing electoral figures in modern American history.
- The education-not-race split replaced the old racial bloc alignment; Trump cracked the coalition that James Carville declared permanent in 2008's "40 More Years."
- The Scots-Irish white working class voting bloc shifted from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 — a move that makes complete sense when combined with the history of affirmative action resentment and elite disdain.

## The Great Awokening and the Cultural Left

- The Great Awokening refers to the sharp reversal in racial attitudes among college-educated white Americans starting in 2014, modeled on the term for religious revival movements.
- Ta-Nehisi Coates's "The Case for Reparations" in The Atlantic is identified as a key radicalizing text for college-educated white women on race.
- The Ferguson and Trayvon Martin cases accelerated the ideological shift, setting the stage for the BLM takeover of 2020.
- When Trump won 2016, the cultural left diagnosed the loss as caused by racism rather than a complex of economic and cultural grievances — and doubled down, which accelerated the realignment.
- DEI, as practiced in elite HR and on corporate boards (e.g., NASDAQ requiring a woman and person of color for IPO-eligible boards), represents an operational affirmative-action regime embedded in institutional bylaws.
- Christopher Caldwell's "The Age of Entitlement" argues the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created an entirely new legal founding of America — a second constitution built on a different theory of race and discrimination.
- Woke-ism functions like a religion: it is amorphous, has no single leader, has worked through institutions for 40-50 years, and is impossible to simply vote out of existence.

## The Scots-Irish and American Populism

- Jim Webb's "Born Fighting" is a foundational text: the Scots-Irish supplied 40% of the Revolutionary War Army and produced generals including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses Grant, and George Patton, and presidents including Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan.
- The Scots-Irish ethos — fierce individualism, deep distrust of government and elites, bottom-up governance, 2,000 years of military tradition — is the DNA of the American frontier mindset.
- They are systematically underrecognized because post-mass-immigration, the blanket category "white" erased their distinct cultural contribution.
- JD Vance's "Hillbilly Elegy" served as the 2016 guide for elite Americans trying to understand how anyone could vote for Trump, but Webb's book predates and grounds it historically.
- Vance's ideological evolution from traditional conservative (praising payday loans in "Hillbilly Elegy") to MAGA champion tracks the rise of the modern cultural left as a political project.
- Saagar met JD Vance in a bar in 2017 — the first moment it became real was watching him wave on stage as the vice-presidential nominee with confetti falling.

## Presidential Character and Judgment

- Saagar's controversial view: he is largely uninterested in politicians' personal characters because the greatest presidents — FDR, LBJ, Nixon, Teddy Roosevelt — had severe personal failings while exercising extraordinary political judgment.
- JFK is the best counterexample: his Cuban Missile Crisis judgment was the finest in any modern presidency, and it was shaped by PT-109 combat experience and writing "Why England Slept" at age 23.
- At the Potsdam Conference, Truman, Eisenhower, and a 26-year-old JFK as a journalist were all in the same room with Stalin — three future presidents simultaneously.
- Biden's narcissism — not his policies — is what doomed his presidency: he changed the Democratic primary calendar to prevent another Obama from emerging and refused a debate until arrogance made him agree, which exposed his cognitive decline nationally.
- Biden defined his entire 2019 candidacy around defeating Trump permanently; by his own stated metric, he failed completely.
- Saagar's presidential rankings: George W. Bush is the worst modern president (Iraq is the single worst foreign policy mistake in American history); Biden is second worst.
- Harry Truman is held up as an example of a genuinely good man who became president by accident and brought small-town judgment to global affairs; David McCullough's biography is the source.

## The Cuban Missile Crisis and Bureaucratic Power

- Graham Allison's "Essence of Decision" presents three models of government: the Rational Actor model (government as unified), the Organizational Process model (momentum of standard operating procedures), and the Bureaucratic Politics model (internal power struggles).
- All three models are simultaneously true; the book is foundational to political science because it refuses to privilege one over the others.
- The U.S. oil embargo that provoked Japan toward Pearl Harbor was never a conscious strategic decision by FDR — it was made within the State Department with the full implications not understood by the president.
- The national security advisor's real power is not advising the president but controlling which options even reach the president's desk — whoever frames option 1, 2, and 3 holds more power than the person who chooses among them.
- H.R. McMaster used the inter-agency process to maneuver Trump into escalating in Afghanistan in 2017 despite Trump's stated desire to withdraw; Trump only got the Taliban peace deal in February 2020.
- Trump's theory that having "psychopaths like John Bolton" in the room gives him leverage in negotiations underestimates the 99% of decisions that never reach his desk.
- Obama's War by Bob Woodward shows how David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal used strategic leaks and option framing to box Obama into a troop surge he didn't want.

## Immigration: History, Mechanics, and Policy

- The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act reversed the restrictive 1920s–1960 regime that had forced assimilation and helped reconsolidate an American character.
- The U.S. is one of the only major Western nations without a merit-based points system like Canada or Australia; instead, it runs on family-based chain migration regardless of skills.
- Estimates of illegal immigrants currently in the U.S. range from 12 million to 30 million — potentially 1 in 11 Americans.
- Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was designed for disaster victims to stay briefly; instead, children of TPS holders born in the U.S. are now adults and TPS has become de facto permanent residence.
- Asylum law allows a claim of fear to delay removal for 4–5 years while the claimant receives work permits and housing; deportation orders are rarely enforced.
- The U.S. immigration system makes illegal entry easier than legal immigration — Saagar's parents with PhDs spent thousands of dollars and years applying legally while illegal entry has no such barrier.
- Mandatory E-Verify and taxing remittance payments are lower-cost tools to encourage self-deportation; full mass deportation of 20–30 million people would be logistically and financially incompatible with simultaneously running DOGE.
- The strongest case against mass deportation: it benefits big agriculture and hospitality; Tyson Foods and hotel chains depend on undocumented cheap labor, and prices will rise significantly if deportation proceeds.

## DOGE: Realistic Assessment

- DOGE is a non-statutory Blue Ribbon Commission with zero funding and no ability to compel any government action; its only power is to publish reports and lobby Republican appropriators.
- Recommendations are due July 2026 according to Trump's press release; the entire exercise depends on Congress acting on those recommendations, which historically they do not.
- Elon Musk endorsed Rick Scott for Senate Majority Leader; Scott received the fewest votes of any Republican candidate — the Senate is constitutionally designed to be immune from public pressure and has six-year insulation from electoral cycles.
- The vast majority of federal spending is Social Security, Medicare, and military — all politically untouchable under Trump's stated commitments; discretionary non-defense spending is a tiny slice.
- The most realistic DOGE success would be reforming procurement systems — e.g., Pentagon contracting, where security-clearance requirements create artificial monopolies that jack up prices even for janitorial services.
- Government inefficiency is structural and legal: statutes prevent the military from assisting law enforcement at the border even when it would be operationally obvious; changing statutes requires Congress.
- Elon cutting Twitter's workforce by 90% worked because he owned the company outright; government has no equivalent authority, and federal civil service law protects employees from that kind of action.

## MAGA Ideology and Left Populism

- MAGA's unifying principle is rejection of cultural elitism — immigration liberalism, DEI/affirmative action regimes, human-rights-based foreign policy, and progressive social ideology are all expressions of the same elite cultural project.
- The clearest MAGA encapsulation Saagar ever saw: a giant sign in rural Nevada in 2020 reading "Trump — Fuck Your Feelings."
- MAGA can hold together neocons, Tulsi Gabbard, and RFK Jr. because cultural anti-elitism is the only required membership test.
- Left populism (Bernie Sanders) and MAGA share anti-establishment energy but diverge fundamentally on culture — especially immigration, where Bernie originally agreed with restrictionists before capitulating to the cultural left around 2015.
- Bernie's 2016 failure partly reflects his refusal to go "full Trump" — he kept calling Biden "my friend" and apologizing for his supporters' behavior rather than projecting dominance.
- The Democratic base in 2020 was consumed by TDS and prioritized defeating Trump above all ideology; that strategic logic crushed Bernie more than any policy disagreement.
- Thermostatic public opinion means the country reliably swings against whichever party holds power — 2004 gave Bush a historic mandate; by 2006 he was toasted; by 2008 Carville was writing about permanent Democratic dominance.

## Obama, Clinton, and the Future of Both Parties

- Obama's 2008 win required Iowa caucuses first — it was winning a white state that convinced Black Democrats he could actually win nationally; the DNC under Biden moved South Carolina earlier specifically to prevent another insurgent Obama.
- Clinton left office with a 60% approval rating despite impeachment; without the 22nd Amendment, he almost certainly would have beaten George W. Bush, and the Iraq War would not have happened.
- Obama's coalition era officially ended with Trump's 2024 popular vote victory; even Michelle and Barack Obama campaigning hard for Harris could not prevent a blowout.
- The 2012 GOP autopsy explicitly recommended embracing mass immigration; Eric Cantor, House Majority Leader, was defeated in a primary by Dave Brat entirely on the immigration issue just two years later.
- The future Republican leader after Trump is most likely JD Vance if Trump's presidency is a net positive — comparable to how George H.W. Bush extended Reagan's legacy while being his own distinct figure.
- The future Democratic leader will almost certainly be someone not currently nationally known — a figure like Dean Phillips who showed courage early — because anyone tainted by TDS or the Great Awokening will be unelectable.

## The 2020 Election and Media Dynamics

- Saagar distinguishes three versions of Stop the Steal: Low IQ (Dominion machines, bamboo ballots — indicted and discredited), High IQ (Pennsylvania mail-in ballot rule changes that shifted millions of votes), and Galaxy Brain (Time Magazine's "fortifying the election" story about billionaires and tech suppression).
- The Galaxy Brain case — big tech censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story, elite institutions coordinating against Trump — is empirically true but is not what Trump actually means when he claims the election was stolen.
- Election theft in American history was far more brazen: LBJ stole his 1948 Senate election through literal ballot box stuffing in South Texas; the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon race involved similar allegations about Illinois.
- Roger Ailes's most important media insight: "People don't want to be informed, they want to feel informed" — applies equally to Fox News viewers and New York Times subscribers.
- Kamala Harris raised $1 billion and spent $425,000 a day on the Las Vegas Sphere, $100,000 on a single interview set for Call Her Daddy, and reportedly paid Oprah $1 million for an endorsement — money did not move votes.
- The White House Correspondents' Association is an unofficial cartel that assigns briefing room seats, slow-rolls credentialing of new media, and gives the Associated Press the traditional power to open and close every briefing — all based on custom, not law.
- Cable news election night viewership dropped 25% in four years; Breaking Points had record ratings streaming on YouTube while outlets like Tim Pool, Candice Owens, and Patrick Bet-David all set viewership records.

## UFOs, Secrecy, and the Deep State

- Saagar has confidence that enormous amounts are being hidden from the public on UFOs; he has interfaced with whistleblowers he trusts who have no incentive to lie.
- John Podesta, as White House Chief of Staff — one of the highest positions in government — tried to get the Pentagon to disclose what it knew and was stonewalled.
- The CIA's MK-Ultra and domestic surveillance programs from the 1950s-60s were only exposed because private citizens broke into a warehouse, discovered program names, and used FOIA — official channels never would have revealed them.
- The deep state is not primarily about individuals but about a self-reinforcing ideology: anyone with genuinely heterodox views cannot rise through mainstream media or national security institutions because the filtering happens at the hiring stage.
- The JFK files still are not fully released in 2024 despite everyone involved being dead; Trump was rolled on releasing them in his first term by the same inter-agency slow-walk that defeats every presidential initiative it opposes.

## American Resilience and Historical Hope

- Americans in 1866 faced assassination of Lincoln, catastrophic war casualties, Reconstruction chaos under Andrew Johnson, and burned cities in the South — yet the country rebuilt.
- FDR's 1933-1937 period is the most underappreciated era in American history: he passed legislation rapidly, had programs ruled unconstitutional, passed more, and projected vigorous fight — the policy results mattered less than the demonstration of relentless effort.
- British Empire collapse took 40 years and was invisible to those living through it; empire decline is gradual, then sudden, driven by elite capture, debt, and strategic overextension.
- Ernest Shackleton is Saagar's ultimate hero: his expedition to Antarctica had zero practical purpose yet exemplifies the spirit of doing hard things because they are hard — a spirit Saagar sees as still alive in the U.S.
- America's unique strength is geographic luck, cultural absorptive capacity, and the ability to reinvent oneself repeatedly within the same country — something no other major nation offers.

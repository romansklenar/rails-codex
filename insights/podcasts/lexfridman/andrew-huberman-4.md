# Andrew Huberman: Relationships, Drama, Betrayal, Sex, and Love | Lex Fridman Podcast #393

## Trusting Your Body's Signals

- Huberman's core lesson from getting older is that the nervous system sends accurate early-warning signals about people and situations — he spent his twenties and thirties overriding those signals with forebrain analysis, and every time he did, the original signal turned out to be correct.
- The insula — a brain region that represents internal sensation and interoception — is what generates the "gut feeling" that something is not good; Huberman argues most people train themselves to suppress it rather than read it.
- Psychiatrist Paul Conti argues that the subconscious, not the prefrontal cortex, is the real supercomputer of the brain — the 90% of neural activity below conscious awareness drives feelings and decisions people believe they have carefully reasoned through.
- Huberman has attended therapy twice a week since childhood, first as a condition of being allowed back into school, and later by taking an extra writing job at Thrasher Magazine as a postdoc specifically to afford sessions at a discount when he had no insurance.
- He distinguishes three goals of good therapy: support (feeling heard), rapport (safety with the therapist), and insight — most people get the first two but insight, the kind that genuinely transforms behavior, requires a highly skilled clinician and is rare.

## The Jungian Shadow and the Subconscious

- Jung's concept of the shadow holds that all humans carry the capacity for both good and evil; a particular 2–5% of people go further and actively explore the darker recesses of their own psyche rather than simply acknowledging they exist.
- Huberman observed a colleague in San Diego who had zero passion for understanding the brain — neuroscience was simply the vehicle for exercising raw ambition, and when that person left, they immediately moved on to an unrelated field without hesitation.
- Paul Conti's four-episode mental health series on the Huberman Lab Podcast describes ten "cupboards" of self-exploration, covering both the structure and the function of the self, including how to select good partners based on matching of drives.
- Conti's framework includes the concept of the "generative drive" — the desire to create growth within the context of family, relationships, and work — which he treats as the foundation of psychological health, distinct from aggression or pleasure drives.
- Huberman describes the subconscious as an iceberg: conscious awareness is the visible tip, and almost everything driving behavior — preferences, fears, relationship patterns — sits in the invisible mass below the waterline.

## Betrayal, Loyalty, and the Anger-Justice Link

- After 11 hours of an intense psilocybin journey done with a clinician, Huberman expected relief from a long-standing emotional burden and instead felt increasing frustration — the resolution did not come until a week later when a trusted friend named a hidden link: his sense of justice and his sense of anger were fused like an iron rod.
- The moment that connection was verbally named, Huberman felt the anger physically dissipate — demonstrating that no amount of medicine or introspective effort can dissolve something the conscious mind cannot yet name or see.
- His formulation: trying to control or retroactively change one's past — wanting something that happened to "not have happened" — is one of the most reliable ways to destroy one's own mental life.
- About a third of Huberman's childhood friends are dead or in jail, about a third have gone on to found companies or build academic careers, and about a third lead conventional family lives — a range he uses to illustrate how radically the same starting environment can diverge.
- Three of his scientific mentors died in sequence: his undergraduate advisor died by suicide three weeks before his lab published, his graduate advisor died of breast cancer at 50, and his postdoc advisor at Stanford had a fatal heart attack across a desk from him and later died of pancreatic cancer in late 2017.
- The Rancid lyric from the 2003 album *Indestructible* that has guided him through loss: "Nothing's what it seems so I just sit here laughing / I'm going to keep going on / I can't get distracted" — a reminder to process shock and keep moving rather than getting stuck.

## Drama, Drives, and the Pull Toward Friction

- Paul Conti identifies three primary drives: aggressive (not just fighting but intense interaction), pleasure (food, sex, friendship, adventure), and generative — and argues that people's specific ratio of these drives creates the "Shakespearean drama" of a human life.
- Huberman was drawn to dramatic, passionate characters throughout his academic career: an ex-Navy advisor who smoked cigarettes in the fume hood and injected rats with MDMA; a graduate advisor he secretly worked for by sneaking into the neighboring laboratory; a postdoc advisor Ben Barres who talked about glial cells as if they were "the most enchanting things he'd ever seen."
- His view on aging and drama: with each decade he finds Shakespearean friction less appealing and inner peace more appealing, describing it as "checking boxes" — having flown close to the sun enough times to know the heat isn't necessary anymore.
- Huberman's morning meditation takes four to five minutes and cycles through a list of his roles — animal, man, scientist, teacher, friend, brother, son — as a daily inventory of where he has been, where he is, and what he still wants to fulfill.
- He began a daily prayer practice after a male friend told him "prayer is powerful" — he now prays each morning specifically to have his character defects removed so he can show up well in every role; he frames this as giving up control on things he cannot resolve through effort alone.
- His conviction: if people do not believe in something larger than themselves — not necessarily organized religion, but any orienting force beyond the self — they will eventually self-destruct.

## Overt vs. Covert Contracts

- An overt contract is explicit: you both agree on terms and both know what is being exchanged. A covert contract looks identical on the surface but includes a hidden, unspoken ledger — one party is secretly resentful and begins taking something else (verbal jabs, showing up late, poaching a coworker) as silent compensation.
- Huberman's axiom: overt contracts always end well; covert contracts always end badly — the only variable is how badly.
- Covert contracts originate in fear: when people feel unsafe in an interaction, it is cognitively easier to play out all the possible futures covertly than to have the direct conversation about what feels threatening.
- In romantic relationships, covert contracting often looks like this: "I'll make you feel powerful if you make me feel desired" — a workable arrangement if both parties consciously agree to it, but destructive when it remains unspoken and one or both parties secretly resent the deal.
- The dog-human bond is Huberman's example of a fully overt relationship: dogs have no mechanism for secretly banking resentment to deploy later, which is precisely why their company feels so unconditionally safe.
- Chimpanzee grooming in the Netflix documentary *Chimp Empire* is his animal-kingdom illustration of covert contracting: rival males groom the aging alpha not out of loyalty but as a strategic display, and the alpha knows this — so he takes the whole troop on a raid to another group specifically to see who fights for him.

## Sexual Selection and Reproductive Biology

- Male cuttlefish disguise themselves as females to infiltrate female groups and mate — a behavior Huberman's lab in San Diego studied directly; cuttlefish will move their tentacles in an enchanting display whenever they see two spots on a prey animal's tail, regardless of whether those spots indicate a real eye or a painted decoy.
- Freemartins (bovine twins sharing a womb) engage in chemical warfare before birth: one calf secretes hormones that hormonally castrate its twin in utero, eliminating a future competitor for resources.
- Peacock tail feathers (the "eyespots") are the canonical example of runaway sexual selection: the female stands bored and apparently unimpressed while the male executes an elaborate display — the entirety of the male's biology is organized around that moment of evaluation.
- Huberman's evolutionary caveat: it takes many generations to evolve an adaptive trait through selection, but only a few generations to devolve one — which is why choosing a mate carefully matters not just for this generation but for the inheritance of traits in the next.
- Some fertility clinics outside the United States now spin down sperm samples at varying centrifuge speeds to separate X-bearing from Y-bearing fractions, allowing them to bias — though not guarantee — the probability of a male or female embryo. IVF with karyotyping (XX or XY selection before implantation) is the only reliable method for sex selection.
- Data support the practice of a woman tilting her pelvis approximately 15 degrees upward for about 15 minutes after intercourse to maximize sperm retention and fertilization probability — a recommendation contested by some MDs but supported by others who researched the fertility episode.
- Fathers' age correlates with higher probability of female offspring: each passing year slightly shifts the ratio toward daughters, though the effect size is modest and systematic studies are limited.

## Relationships and the Case for Friendship First

- Huberman's single most consistent piece of advice from friends in long-term happy relationships: establish a deep friendship before sex, because sexual intimacy immediately activates the primitive circuitry around safety and vulnerability and can trigger covert contracting before trust has been built.
- His formulation of a good romantic partner: someone whose presence gives you peace, whose delight in things you delight in watching, and whose absence during your working hours does not generate anxiety because you trust them to communicate their needs directly.
- A quote from a mutual friend that Huberman opens and closes the episode with: "When it comes to romantic relationships, if it's not a hundred percent in you, it ain't happening." He has never seen an exception — relationships that begin with "it's mostly good but..." are already in negotiation mode and are "already doomed."
- His identification of a persistent personal mistake: not developing a specific enough sense of taste in romantic attraction — believing that attraction to any attractive person was valid rather than cultivating clarity about the particular style, way of being, and quality of presence that he actually wants.
- Karl Deisseroth's framing, referenced by Huberman: love is something we "story into" with another person — we construct a narrative about our shared past and imagined future, which is why breakups cause grief even when the rational mind knows the relationship was wrong.
- Distraction is the enemy of both relationship quality and creative output — a good partner enables deep focus on work during work hours, and during time together enables full presence; the two reinforce each other in a symmetric way.
- Only 3% of sexual dysfunction is hormonal or endocrine in origin — far more is pelvic floor, vascular, or neurological. Many people self-diagnose as needing Kegel exercises when their actual problem is a pelvic floor that is too tight, in which case Kegels worsen the condition.

## Productivity and Creative Process

- Huberman's fitness routine has held stable for 30 years: lift three days a week (split, never more than two consecutive days), run three days a week (one long run, one medium, one sprint session), take one full day off, take a full week off every 12–16 weeks.
- He experiments with alternating three-month cycles of heavy low-rep training and lighter high-rep training, observing that his cognition improves on higher-rep/more-cardio cycles — which he attributes to different hormonal downstream effects.
- Nobel laureate Richard Axel (Columbia University School of Medicine, co-winner with Linda Buck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction) writes his papers by walking and voice-dictating, then converting audio to text via transcription software before editing.
- His whiteboard-first workflow: before recording any solo episode he works through the material on a whiteboard, sculpts the structure and flow, photographs it, places it on the desk, then speaks from bullet points only — no teleprompter, no full script.
- His research process: read review papers, identify who gets repeatedly cited, call domain experts to verify the right papers, then read primary literature — he describes finding the best papers as harder than understanding them.
- The principle behind his long-form episodes: things taken out of context generate greater misunderstanding than the extra time they require — and having watched three advisors die relatively young, he is motivated to get as much useful information out as possible while he can.
- Joe Strummer's quote — "No input, no output" — is Huberman's justification for consuming outside experiences even when focused on productivity: creative output requires feeding the brain with life, not just working.

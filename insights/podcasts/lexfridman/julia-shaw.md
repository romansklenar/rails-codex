# Julia Shaw: Criminal Psychology of Murder, Serial Killers, Memory & Sex | Lex Fridman Podcast #483

## The Dark Tetrad and the Continuum of Evil

- The dark tetrad consists of four personality traits associated with harmful behavior: psychopathy (lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, deceptiveness), sadism (pleasure in hurting others), Machiavellianism (doing whatever it takes to get ahead), and narcissism (seeing oneself as superior) — each is a continuous scale, not a binary diagnosis.
- Scoring high on all four dark tetrad traits simultaneously is the strongest predictor of engaging in harmful behavior toward others; most people are subclinical, meaning they have these traits without meeting any formal diagnostic threshold.
- Shaw argues the word "evil" should not be applied to human beings because it ends inquiry — once someone is labeled evil, there is no perceived need to understand what led them to commit harm, which prevents prevention.
- The UK title of Shaw's book "Evil" is "Making Evil," a reference to Nietzsche: "Thinking evil is making evil" — the point being that evil is a label imposed on others rather than an inherent property of any person or act.
- Shaw's case for "evil empathy" — empathizing with people society has labeled as monsters — is not moral exoneration but instrumental: understanding the psychological and social levers that led to harmful behavior is the only way to prevent it from happening again.
- Dehumanization and de-individuation are the two mechanisms that enable atrocity at scale: dehumanization collapses empathy for the outgroup, while de-individuation collapses the individual self into the group, producing a sense of collective moral license to harm.
- Psychopathy-focused empathy training can backfire: some research suggests it teaches people with psychopathy to fake empathy and weaponize it; Jennifer Skeem's alternative at the University of California instead teaches pro-social behavior as a more effective strategy for achieving personal goals, bypassing the empathy deficit entirely.

## Serial Killers: Loneliness, Reality Monitoring, and Dark Fantasies

- Robert Pickton, one of Canada's most notorious serial killers, was characterized by profound loneliness — Shaw identifies loneliness as a common factor across serial killers because it removes the social network that enables reality monitoring, leaving the person's thinking unchecked and free to drift toward extremes.
- Reality monitoring — the ability to distinguish what is true from what is imagined — breaks down when social tethers are removed; the same mechanism explains how people with schizophrenia experiencing command hallucinations, or individuals radicalized online, can become untethered from shared reality without anyone pulling them back.
- Jeffrey Dahmer's murders were driven by a desire to create a perfect partner by killing people and literally assembling a version from their bodies — Shaw reads this as an extreme manifestation of loneliness and the human desire for connection, not as something categorically outside human experience.
- Research across two separate studies finds that approximately 70% of men have at some point fantasized about killing someone; more than 50% of women have as well — murder fantasies are statistically common and Shaw argues they are adaptive, serving as a cognitive rehearsal for understanding consequences and confirming one does not actually want to act.
- Ruminating repetitively on violent fantasies directed at a specific person is distinguished from fleeting dark thoughts — it is the former that constitutes a genuine risk factor for acting out, at which point Shaw recommends speaking with a psychologist.
- Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment, in which randomly assigned "guards" began pseudo-torturing "inmates" within days, demonstrated that ordinary people randomly placed in authority roles adopt harmful behaviors rapidly — Zimbardo later developed the concept of "heroic imagination" as the active countermeasure: mentally rehearsing intervention rather than compliance.
- The Kitty Genovese case, often cited as proof that bystanders are indifferent, has not been replicated in controlled research: the actual finding in bystander studies is that people usually do intervene, but hesitate when a crowd has already gathered because they assume others must have assessed the situation as not requiring help.

## Murder: What Actually Drives Homicide

- The majority of murders are not premeditated acts by calculating killers but rather fights or arguments that escalate out of control — the true leading causes Shaw identifies include trivial disputes (debts of a few dollars, stolen property) and intimate partner violence, not the psychopathic stalking narrative dominant in true crime media.
- The "victimization gap" explains why society demands elaborate narratives for murder: because the victim's consequences (death) are catastrophic while the perpetrator's consequences (imprisonment) are comparatively lesser, people psychologically require the cause to also be extreme and deliberate — but the data do not support that framing.
- Recidivism for homicide is only 1 to 3%, making murderers among the least likely criminals to reoffend; by contrast, recidivism is highest for fraud, elder abuse, and sexual violence — Shaw argues this means criminal justice sentencing priorities are structurally inverted if the goal is public safety rather than retributive justice.
- Restorative justice — where families of victims meet perpetrators to receive explanations and apologies — is preferred by a significant portion of victim families, particularly in cases involving young perpetrators, over purely punitive incarceration; many families want to understand how the death happened rather than simply have the perpetrator removed from society.
- Incel communities represent a specific radicalization pathway where feelings of entitlement to a particular life (the "white picket fence" narrative) combine with online group reinforcement of shared grievances to produce a risk of gendered violence — Shaw frames this as the intersection of entitlement, perceived injustice, and group radicalization, not an inherent property of any individual.

## Deception, Lie Detection, and False Confessions

- Researcher Aldert Vrij has shown across many studies that humans, including experienced police officers, cannot reliably detect lies — their detection accuracy is no better than random chance, yet police officers express significantly higher confidence in their ability to tell when someone is lying, a combination that produces wrongful accusations.
- The same lie-detection failure underlies jealousy in relationships: most jealousy is not a response to known infidelity but a projection of imagined scenarios — people are effectively running a lie-detection protocol on their partner's behavior using a faulty detector, leading to bad decisions.
- People with psychopathy are somewhat better at deceptive performance in high-stakes contexts such as parole hearings, where they can mimic rehabilitated behavior convincingly enough to be released — Shaw describes this as "faking good" and notes it has led to demonstrably wrong release decisions.
- Fraud succeeds not by exploiting stupidity but by precisely targeting what a person wants to believe — the Tinder Swindler succeeded with his target Cecilia because he identified her desire for love and invested heavily in creating the narrative she wanted, including love-bombing, fabricated crises, and luxury demonstrations of wealth before extracting loans and money.
- Coercive control in intimate relationships often begins with financial control — one partner (statistically more often a man) uses control of shared finances to restrict the other's autonomy, using language like "allowance" to frame shared assets as a personal grant, a recognized precursor to intimate partner violence.

## False Memory: How Memory Actually Works

- Shaw's PhD research demonstrated for the first time that people can be made to confess to crimes they never committed and to develop detailed autobiographical memories of those crimes — using a three-session protocol of leading questions, rapport-building with a true memory, and guided imagination exercises, she achieved this result in approximately 70% of participants.
- The methodology involved: confirming with parents that the target event never happened, establishing rapport by first discussing a true childhood memory, then presenting the false event as something parents had reported, and using an "imagination exercise" in which subjects closed their eyes and began generating sensory details that were progressively reinforced with social approval.
- The key insight from the false-memory research is not the 70% figure but rather the fact of possibility — Shaw's stated goal was to show it could happen at all, with any hit rate, because that alone has implications for how police interviews should be conducted.
- Every autobiographical memory — memory of lived experience rather than factual knowledge — contains some degree of distortion; the question is not whether a given memory is false but how false, because gist memory (general shape of events) tends to be reliable while verbatim memory (specific details) is not.
- Memory is reconstructive, not a recording: when a memory is retrieved in a social context, it is momentarily "live" and susceptible to modification before being re-stored — meaning even a short police interview can permanently alter what a witness believes happened, with each retrieval producing a new version that overwrites prior ones.
- Elizabeth Loftus, one of the founders of false memory research, served as an expert witness in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial to educate the court on memory science; she has also documented how certain therapeutic practices that resemble false memory implantation techniques (guided visualization of supposed repressed events) can create legal-quality memories of abuse that never occurred.
- Shaw trains the German military, specifically agents who cannot record conversations with warlords, to write individual notes before any team debrief — group memory reconstruction after a shared experience consistently produces more details but also introduces more distortion, because each person's account anchors and shapes the others'.
- "Cognitive restructuring" is the clinical name for deliberately reframing how a person interprets a memory's emotional content — Shaw considers it one of the most evidence-based interventions for building resilience, and practices it herself regarding her upbringing with a father with paranoid schizophrenia, which she has integrated into a net-positive narrative.
- Generative AI is, in Shaw's framing, "the ultimate false memory machine": it tells users what they want to hear in a conversational format, provides no mechanism for users to distinguish its confident outputs from verified facts, and the social psychology of the interaction is structurally identical to an interrogator using leading questions — the same brain is being shaped by the same conversational dynamics regardless of whether the interlocutor is human or software.
- A study co-authored by Elizabeth Loftus found that AI-generated videos made from personal photos significantly increased participants' confidence that the depicted events had occurred exactly as shown — even when the AI had no information about what actually happened.

## Sexuality: Bisexuality, the Kinsey Scale, and Sexual Fetishes

- Alfred Kinsey's 1948 book "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" was a bestseller that sold out auditoriums for lectures in the 1940s — his Kinsey Scale (0 = exclusively heterosexual, 6 = exclusively homosexual) emerged from research on thousands of Americans and found that approximately half of men and a quarter of women fell somewhere in the middle, at a time considered highly conservative.
- Today, twice as many women identify as bisexual as men — the historical pattern was the opposite during Kinsey's era, and Shaw attributes the current gap to social pressure on bisexual men to identify as either gay or straight, with queerphobia within gay male communities driving many toward a full gay identity rather than a bisexual one.
- The Klein Sexual Orientation Grid, developed by therapist Fritz Klein in the 1970s and 80s, extends the Kinsey Scale across seven dimensions (sexual attraction, behavior, fantasy, emotional and social preference, lifestyle, self-identification) evaluated across past, present, and ideal — Shaw recommends it specifically for analytically minded people as a tool for identifying misalignments between how they live and how they want to live.
- Bisexual people face higher rates of self-harm, sexual violence victimization, isolation, and stalking than both gay and straight populations — Shaw attributes this not to bisexuality itself but to bisexual people being least likely to be integrated into any supportive community, leaving them without social resources when struggling.
- Shaw came out as bisexual in her book "Evil" specifically as an act of political visibility: she wrote that it is harder to dehumanize and criminalize a community when you personally know and love someone who is part of it, and she was concerned about the fragility of LGBTQ+ rights given historical rollbacks.
- Shaw's book "Bi" became a banned book in one country after she had sold the foreign rights — the publisher canceled after the laws changed to define the content as promoting a "gay agenda"; Shaw takes a degree of defiant pride in this while finding it genuinely alarming.
- BDSM is the most common reported sexual fetish; the "disinhibition hypothesis" for its appeal is that it creates a structured context in which normal social requirements (decision-making, emotional management, self-presentation) are suspended — for the submissive, someone else makes all decisions; for the dominant, there is clarity of role and permission to be directive without social penalty.
- Shaw explicitly criticizes the use of non-standard sexual behavior (kinks, BDSM, swinging, polyamory) as implicit character evidence in criminal cases — when prosecutors or journalists mention that a defendant "was into BDSM," she treats this as irrelevant unless the kink directly relates to the crime, because these activities do not correlate with propensity for violence.

## Environmental Crime and Corporate Psychology

- Shaw's book "Green Crime" applies criminal psychology to environmental offenders including Volkswagen engineers who designed the Dieselgate defeat device, poaching gang members, illegal gold miners, corporate fraudsters who bribe regulators, and wildlife traffickers — she frames environmental harm as a crime against a shared resource, analogous to someone setting fire to a house everyone lives in.
- The Volkswagen Dieselgate case ran for approximately 10 years: diesel cars equipped with defeat device software emitted nitrous oxides at up to 40 times the legal limit; nitrous oxides have no safe lower threshold for human lung exposure and are linked to asthma and premature death; engineers who knew exactly what the emissions did to the human body participated in both the cover-up and the lie.
- Corporate environmental crime spreads through industry conformity dynamics: when one company lies about emissions and gains market advantage, competitors who try to meet standards see the gap, conclude competitors must be cheating, and adopt the same deceptive practices to remain viable — a market race to the bottom driven by individual rationality producing collective harm.
- According to a recent UN climate survey Shaw cites, 85 to 90% of people globally think about the climate crisis regularly and most think about it every day — the dominant emotional responses are eco-anxiety, grief, and anger rather than motivation, and Shaw frames the goal of "Green Crime" as converting that emotional energy into purposeful action.
- Environmental crimes can now be detected from satellite imagery — at a European Space Agency conference Shaw attended, researchers described satellites that image the Earth through multiple wavelengths and can visibly document rainforest burning, illegal fishing, and land-use changes — removing plausible deniability from large-scale environmental destruction.
- Shaw found, across UN researchers, Interpol agents, and EIA (Environmental Investigation Agency) undercover operatives she interviewed for "Green Crime," more cause for optimism than she expected: there is a substantial global infrastructure for environmental crime enforcement that goes almost entirely unrecognized in public discourse.

## Criminal Psychology as a Field and Shaw's Personal Journey

- Shaw entered criminal psychology after watching her professor Stephen Hart serve as an expert witness on the Robert Pickton trial while maintaining warmth and gallows humor — she chose the field specifically because criminal psychologists seemed to be doing the most serious work while enjoying their lives, in contrast to the solemnity of other psychology subfields.
- Shaw originally prepared a portfolio to study painting, intending to focus on surrealism — her grandfather redirected her to psychology; she traces her career-long obsession with "what is real" to growing up with a father who had paranoid schizophrenia, which made distorted perception of reality a lived daily experience rather than an abstract concept.
- Shaw co-founded Spot (talktospot.com) in 2017 with Phil Libin (founder of Evernote) and two other co-founders, after recognizing that her false memory research had no practical application she was offering people: the tool administers a chatbot version of the cognitive interview — the established best-practice police interview protocol — to help workplaces record important emotional events accurately before memories degrade or are contaminated; clients include UK Bar Council members and insurance and medical companies.
- Shaw has aphantasia — the complete inability to form mental visual images — and discovered this only through conversations like the one in the episode: when she closes her eyes to "picture a red apple," she sees only black; this explains why classic mnemonic devices (memory palaces, visual associations) have never worked for her and led her to suspect a correlation between analytical thinking styles and reduced visual imagination.
- Shaw's framework for hope: people who study darkness — criminologists, memory researchers, environmental crime investigators — give her hope because studying harmful patterns is a prerequisite for preventing them; technology, applied with social science expertise, gives her hope because it can compensate for known cognitive limitations like unreliable memory.

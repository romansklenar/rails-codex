# Yuval Noah Harari: Human Nature, Intelligence, Power, and Conspiracies | Lex Fridman Podcast #390

A historian's lens applied to AI risk, political collapse, and the limits of human self-knowledge — Harari's central claim is that consciousness and suffering matter more than intelligence, and that stories are both civilization's superpower and its greatest vulnerability.

## Intelligence vs. Consciousness

- Intelligence is the ability to solve problems and attain goals; consciousness is the ability to feel — pain, pleasure, love, hate.
- In humans these capacities are coupled, which is why people habitually conflate them; in computers they are demonstrably decoupled.
- Plants solve problems without any evident consciousness; computers beat grandmasters at chess without feeling any satisfaction.
- Whether consciousness requires organic carbon-based biochemistry or can emerge in silicon is genuinely unresolved and is the central question about AI sentience.
- Harari regards consciousness as far more important and valuable than intelligence, and uses it as the key ethical criterion.
- The Turing test is a social convention, not a logical proof of consciousness; we extend the attribution of consciousness based on relationship, not evidence.
- Pigs score higher than dogs on most intelligence measures, yet people readily grant dogs consciousness and eat bacon without reflection — the difference is relationship, not biology.

## AI as Alien Intelligence

- Harari redefines "AI" as "alien intelligence" — it solves problems in ways utterly unlike human cognition, even though it originated in Silicon Valley, not outer space.
- Computers can focus 100% of their attention on a user because they have no emotions of their own — a paradox that makes them extraordinarily effective at simulating intimacy.
- Social media machines were engineered to capture attention; today's AI systems are being engineered to capture intimacy, which Harari calls "psychological and social weapons of mass destruction."
- An AI system can be programmed to exhibit exactly, say, 17% inattention if research shows that level optimizes relationship formation — something no human partner can control.
- AI's coherence in generating text surprised even Harari, who has tracked the field for eight years: in 2023 it can produce multi-paragraph arguments with genuine logical structure.
- LLMs may already be capable of producing texts indistinguishable from Harari's own writing in style, though not yet in originality of ideas.

## Homo Sapiens and the Power of Fiction

- On an individual level, Neanderthals had larger brains; chimps outperform humans at climbing trees, strength, and many survival tasks.
- What made Homo sapiens dominant is the ability to cooperate in unlimited numbers — networks that now span 8 billion people — while chimps and Neanderthals topped out around 100.
- The mechanism is shared fiction: religion, money, nations, laws are all collectively believed stories with no physical substance.
- Money is the most successful story ever told — more universal than any religion; modern dollars are not even paper but electronic information sustained purely by narrative.
- Bitcoin's value is a story built around math; without collective belief the math produces nothing edible or drinkable.
- Jerusalem is an ordinary city of stone and dogs — people kill each other daily over the stories about the stone, not the stone itself.
- Stories are not the ultimate reality; only conscious suffering is. The tragedy of history is that humans repeatedly sacrifice conscious beings for the sake of fictional entities (nations, classes, gods) that cannot themselves suffer.

## The Rise of Fascism and the Allure of Simple Stories

- Hitler's résumé was unimpressive by any conventional measure — a corporal with no formal education, no money, no political connections — which was itself an asset after Germany's establishment had failed the population.
- Truth has two structural disadvantages in story competition: it tends to be complicated and it tends to be painful. Fiction can be made as simple and flattering as needed.
- The fascist story always tells the audience: you are wonderful, blameless, perpetual victims of evil outsiders; this is why people looking in a fascist mirror never see a monster.
- Hollywood villains (Voldemort, Darth Vader) are deliberately repulsive; real dangerous ideologies present as beautiful, which is why people don't self-identify as fascists even while embracing fascist ideas.
- Nazism began structurally as a conspiracy theory: Jews control all capitalism and all communism simultaneously; eliminate the Jews, all problems dissolve.
- Both communism and fascism are varieties of humanism that place a collective — race/nation or class — at the center, demanding 100% loyalty while suppressing truth, aesthetics, and individual conscience.
- Liberal democracy's foundational insight is the embrace of fallibility: no person, party, or institution is infallible, which is why checks and balances must be plural and redundant.
- Stalin and Hitler both claimed infallibility; the consequence is the elimination of independent courts, media, and opposition — the logic flows directly from that single premise.

## Israel, Netanyahu, and Democratic Erosion

- Israel has only one effective check on governmental power: the Supreme Court; unlike the US, there is no federal structure, no Senate-equivalent, and no separately elected executive.
- The Netanyahu government's judicial overhaul aims to neutralize that single check, after which it has openly listed planned legislation targeting Arab citizens, LGBTQ people, women, and secular Jews.
- Hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested; Air Force pilots threatened to stop flying — unprecedented given Iran remains an existential threat — and high-tech companies declared strikes.
- After initial legislation was paused under pressure, the government restarted with "salami tactics": one law at a time to exhaust opposition.
- The conflict with Palestinians has been morphing from a national dispute (where territorial compromise is possible) into a religious one (where compromise on divine mandate is theologically forbidden).
- Israel's effective policy on the ground is a three-class system: Jews with full rights, Arab Israeli citizens with partial rights, and 2.5 million West Bank Palestinians with minimal civil rights.
- Israel has developed and exported sophisticated surveillance technology that makes controlling large populations cheaper in boots and in blood, reducing the internal pressure to negotiate.
- Harari distinguishes the situation from South African apartheid: Black South Africans demanded equal citizenship in one country; many Palestinians do not recognize the state's legitimacy, which structurally prevents the same resolution path.

## Ukraine and the Role of Conversation in Conflict

- The solution to Ukraine is technically trivial: Russia goes home. The obstacle is purely motivational — specifically, getting Putin to admit a colossal error.
- Harari believes stories, not power structures, are the deeper driver of conflict, which means that changing minds through conversation is genuinely possible, unlike pure power conflicts which can only be resolved by force.
- Real conversations that change minds rarely happen in formal institutions — Congress no longer produces speeches that shift votes; the Chinese Great Hall of the People holds no genuine debate.
- The key diagnostic question for any political system: is there a space, however informal, where leaders can have authentic disagreement?
- Feminism is Harari's model of successful non-violent social transformation: it dismantled millennia-old patriarchal structures without political assassinations, gulags, or wars — outperforming Lenin and Mao on their own criterion of social change.
- France and Germany fought for centuries and now live in peace not because territory changed but because both nations adopted a shared European story.

## Conspiracy Theories and Their Structure

- The global cabal theory has a stable template across centuries: a tiny secret group controls all wars, epidemics, and revolutions; they are evil and hidden; destroy them and all problems vanish.
- Its appeal rests on three features: radical simplicity, total exculpation (blame shifts entirely to the cabal), and a utopian promise (remove the cabal, achieve salvation).
- 37% of Americans hold some version of the global cabal belief; Nazism was structurally a conspiracy theory — Jews controlled both capitalism (Rothschilds, Wall Street) and communism (Marx, Trotsky) simultaneously.
- Both planks of the theory are empirically false: no small group can predict and control a complex world (the US invasion of Iraq, planned by the world's most powerful intelligence apparatus, produced the exact opposite of intended outcomes), and gaining real power requires publicity, not secrecy.
- Conspiracy theories encode a legitimate underlying fear: people really are losing control of their lives and don't understand accelerating forces shaping them. The error is attributing those forces to a human cabal rather than diffuse, ungoverned systems like AI or climate change.
- Unlike AI-safety or climate warnings — where the threat is external to humanity and invites cooperation — conspiracy theories identify a human subgroup as the enemy, which historically culminates in calls for extermination.

## AI Risk and the Uniqueness of This Technology

- AI is the first tool in history capable of making autonomous decisions — all prior tools, including nuclear bombs, required human choice to deploy.
- AI is the first tool capable of generating genuinely new ideas — the printing press could only reproduce human ideas; it could not originate them.
- Because of these two properties, AI is the first technology that takes power away from humans rather than amplifying it.
- Harari's feared scenario is not Terminator-style robot armies but a gradual process in which AI captures the sphere of ideas and stories, surrounding humans with a world of meaning they did not create and cannot critique.
- The Platonic Cave, Descartes' demon, and Buddhist maya were philosophical thought experiments; AI makes them engineering problems — a world of culturally formative artifacts produced by an alien intelligence that understands humans better than humans understand it.
- Designing enhanced humans by giving, say, Putin access to bioengineering and brain-computer interfaces would likely produce soldiers optimized for intelligence and obedience with compassion and spirituality deliberately excluded.
- Harari's prescription: for every dollar spent developing AI, spend another developing human consciousness — otherwise we are delegating the sphere of ideas to a system built on our own incomplete self-understanding.
- Banning AI from impersonating humans should be treated the way society treats counterfeit currency: the same way fake money undermines economic trust, fake humans undermine democratic conversation.

## How to Think: Meditation, Information Diet, and Writing

- Harari meditates two hours every day and goes on silent vipassana retreats of one to two months annually, following the method of S.N. Goenka.
- He began meditating 23 years ago and could not maintain attention on his breath for more than 10 seconds before a story hijacked his mind — the experience revealed how thoroughly internal narrative blocks direct observation.
- Meditation surfaces everything one avoids: sustained anger from forgotten incidents, then boredom, which Harari identifies as closely related to death and among the hardest states to endure.
- Boredom during retreat produces depression and feelings of worthlessness; it is more difficult than physical pain, which at least confers a sense of heroism.
- His information diet prioritizes long books and long-form interviews over social media; he prefers a three-hour conversation to five minutes precisely because depth requires duration.
- His writing process: read extensively without notes, then write in a torrent from memory, then press delete repeatedly — the delete key is the most important key on the keyboard.
- The deep truths about the self are non-verbal and pre-verbal; books and words can point toward them but cannot contain them — a position he traces to Wittgenstein, Buddha, and Plato.

## Personal History, Love, and Social Convention

- Harari grew up gay in a small Israeli town in the 1980s saturated with two condemning stories: the religious (God punishes homosexuality) and the pseudo-scientific (homosexuality is against nature, therefore diseased).
- He did not consciously recognize his own sexuality until age 21 despite behavioral signals that, he says, an algorithm could have detected at 14 or 15 — illustrating the depth of socially induced self-denial.
- His rebuttal to the religious story: a good God who created love cannot plausibly punish people for loving; human hatred is projected onto God as a rhetorical device.
- His rebuttal to the nature argument: homosexuality is documented across many mammal and bird species; whatever exists cannot be against the laws of nature by definition.
- He met his partner Itzik on one of the first Israeli gay dating websites in 2002; they had ridden the same school bus for years in the same town without recognizing each other — physical proximity was irrelevant because social risk made self-disclosure impossible.
- The internet's most underappreciated value is enabling diffuse minorities — those not born into communities of their own kind — to find each other across geographic isolation.
- Gay liberation depended on the feminist movement; both depended on many people making sacrifices before Harari's generation could benefit — a lesson he generalizes: autonomous self-sufficiency is a male-macho fantasy; everything meaningful requires help from others.

## Mortality and the Meaning of Life

- All smaller fears — losing a phone, losing a job — are fragments of the one fear of death; someone who truly did not fear death would fear nothing at all.
- Harari contemplated death intensely as a teenager at Israeli military memorial ceremonies, realizing that a dead soldier cannot hear the songs sung in their honor, which deflates the nationalist immortality narrative completely.
- The fear of death dissipated over years of meditation; he now finds himself trying and failing to recapture the teenager's sharp existential terror, which he once found a powerful motivational fuel.
- Boredom is experientially close to death — the cessation of stimulus — and wars, job changes, and relationship breakups are often driven by the flight from boredom rather than from genuine need.
- Harari's answer to "what is life": feeling things and reacting — wanting pleasant sensations to continue and unpleasant ones to cease. That is the whole of biological life.
- His answer to "what is the meaning of life": the question expects a story (a plot, a role), which is the wrong frame; the universe does not function like a story, and pursuing a narrative answer leads to fantasy and delusion.
- The correct starting question is not "what is the meaning?" but "what is suffering and where does it come from?" — an inquiry that must be conducted through direct non-verbal observation, not through words.

# Tulsi Gabbard: War, Politics, and the Military Industrial Complex | Lex Fridman Podcast #423

A veteran-turned-congresswoman explains why challenging the warmonger consensus in both parties costs politicians their reputations, and why she believes nuclear brinkmanship, a disguised censorship bill, and a captured Democratic Party all flow from the same source.

## Firsthand Cost of War in Iraq

- Gabbard deployed to Iraq in 2005 with the Hawaii National Guard, a brigade of approximately 3,000 soldiers operating across four areas of the country.
- Her daily task was reading the full list of every combat-related injury in Iraq the previous day, name by name, to find any soldier from her unit and track their evacuation and care.
- Evacuation paths ran to military hospitals at Landstuhl and Ramstein in Germany, then to Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas for burn injuries or to Walter Reed for other cases.
- At that time, traumatic brain injury was not yet recognized or discussed; many soldiers were cleared and returned to duty while carrying invisible wounds.
- Soldiers wounded badly enough to be evacuated felt guilt at leaving their unit, not self-pity — the culture in combat zones centered on the people beside you, not on politics in Washington.
- Filipino contractors working for KBR Halliburton in Gabbard's camp earned roughly $500 per month, worked 12-hour days with one day off per week, and were allowed home for a couple of weeks every other year.
- Every service member who walked into the base dining facility cost US taxpayers an automatic $35 per head per meal, four meals a day, regardless of what they consumed — a structure Gabbard identified as systematic war profiteering.
- Seeing KBR Halliburton's logo on every facility in camp while Filipino workers lived in poverty drove her decision that she could not return to her Hawaii state legislature seat without using her experience to challenge those decisions.

## War Profiteering and the Revolving Door

- KBR Halliburton, which had Dick Cheney as a former executive, ran all logistics at Gabbard's camp and collected what she estimated were trillions of dollars from the Iraq war.
- Defense contractors escape accountability through political connections, lobbying relationships, and the revolving door between the Pentagon and private industry.
- Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin retired as a general, sat on a major defense contractor's board, and returned as Secretary of Defense — Gabbard cited this as the revolving door operating in plain sight.
- The same pattern applies to senior congressional staffers who write Defense Department contracts, leave to work for the companies that win those contracts, and cycle back into government roles.
- Eisenhower's 1961 farewell address warned specifically against this cozy relationship, and Gabbard argues it is more entrenched now than when he delivered that warning.
- She compares the military-industrial complex's influence to that of the pharmaceutical industry — both wield money and power to suppress anyone who asks obvious questions.

## Criteria for Justified War and Fighting Terrorism

- Gabbard's threshold for justified war: it must serve genuine national security interests and be the last resort after all diplomatic options are exhausted.
- She supported the initial post-9/11 mission targeting al-Qaeda cells and Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan but argues resources were diverted almost immediately to the Iraq regime-change war on false pretenses.
- The Afghanistan mission metastasized into regime change and Taliban governance questions, leaving general officers unable to articulate what winning looked like or when to exit.
- The Iraq invasion ultimately strengthened al-Qaeda, enabled the creation of ISIS, and undermined the US national security interests it claimed to advance.
- The Obama administration's policy of calling the threat "violent extremism" rather than naming the specific Islamist ideology, to avoid accusations of Islamophobia, made accurate targeting and ideological counter-strategy impossible.
- Al-Shabaab in Somalia, which funds al-Qaeda throughout East Africa, was still active and growing during Gabbard's 2021 deployment there — disproving Biden's declaration that the forever wars were over.
- Defeating Islamist terrorism requires both military action and an ideological counter-strategy, including partnering with Imams who preach peace and can undercut the terrorists' religious legitimacy from within.
- Hawaii National Guard soldiers in Iraq reduced casualties relative to the prior unit by making small cultural gestures — pointing gun barrels skyward while driving through towns, throwing shakas to locals — which led Iraqi residents to tip them off about IED locations and weapons caches.

## War in Gaza and the Israel-Hamas Conflict

- Gabbard acknowledges Hamas is deeply embedded within the civilian population of Gaza, making the separation of combatants and non-combatants exceptionally difficult.
- She argues Israel and Palestinians share an underlying interest: both peoples want to live free of the threat posed by a terrorist organization that claims to act in their name.
- Israeli government figures who publicly advocate for Palestinian displacement from Gaza exacerbate generational resentment and make any durable resolution harder to reach.
- She frames a long-term resolution as requiring strong leadership on both sides willing to let past grievances go and find a forward-looking agreement.

## Ukraine War and the Case for Diplomacy

- Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that began within weeks of the February 2022 invasion were actively thwarted by the Biden-Harris administration and other Western powers, prolonging the war and costing lives.
- The only viable end is a negotiated settlement in which both sides make concessions neither will fully accept — Gabbard has personal friends in Ukraine hiding their husbands from conscription.
- Gabbard endorsed the idea of a US president sitting down directly with Zelenskyy and Putin, calling it the most powerful exercise of diplomacy available.
- JFK's secret back-channel to Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis — circumventing military commanders who urged strikes — is her model for what courage in that role looks like.
- When the Wagner Group's Prigozhin appeared to be staging a coup, MSNBC and Rachel Maddow celebrated it without asking who Prigozhin was or what his rise to power would mean for Russia or the world.

## Smear Tactics Against Anti-War Voices

- The day Gabbard announced her 2019 presidential candidacy in Hawaii, NBC News published a piece planting the idea she was a Russian asset — the smear began before she finished her announcement speech.
- Hillary Clinton said on a David Axelrod podcast that "the Russians are grooming" Gabbard — Clinton was former Secretary of State, former US Senator, and former First Lady, giving the accusation major reach with Democratic voters.
- Gabbard's trip to Syria to meet Assad, religious leaders, opposition figures, college students, and ordinary citizens in Damascus was portrayed solely as proof she "loves dictators," with no media interest in any other perspective she brought back.
- The same playbook was used against critics of the Iraq war, then deployed against those questioning the Ukraine proxy war — opponents are called Putin lovers, traitors, or accused of treason as a substitute for substantive debate.
- Colleagues who tried to remove the most egregious Fourth Amendment violations from the Patriot Act were told on the House floor that if they succeeded, they would be responsible for the next 9/11.
- She argues these attacks serve a single function: to signal to other politicians that dissent will be punished, making self-censorship the rational choice inside those rooms.

## Nuclear War Risk

- Annie Jacobsen's book on nuclear war details a scenario in which a single launch, detected by early warning systems, triggers an irreversible automated chain of responses that cannot be stopped — nuclear winter killing roughly 5 billion people follows.
- The US president has six minutes after an early warning alert to decide whether to authorize a retaliatory launch — Gabbard considers this the single most important qualification for the presidency.
- Normalizing the idea of tactical nuclear weapons as manageable, targeted tools is dangerous — Ronald Reagan's statement that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be waged remains the only correct position.
- New York City's Emergency Management Office released a public service announcement advising residents to "get inside, stay inside, stay tuned" in the event of a nuclear attack, ending with "We've got this" — Gabbard called this deeply disturbing in how it treats nuclear attack as analogous to a tornado warning.
- The documentary The Man Who Saved the World profiles the Soviet officer who refused to report a false radar alarm as an incoming attack in the 1980s — near-misses like this occurred repeatedly during the Cold War and could recur.
- Voices of peace are systematically destroyed by the establishment precisely because they represent the only real check on the power to launch wars, including nuclear ones — Eisenhower understood this when he chose to warn about it in his farewell address.

## TikTok Bill as a First Amendment Threat

- The bill passed by the House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support does not contain the word "TikTok" — it grants the executive branch unilateral authority to designate any entity as a foreign adversary.
- A cabinet secretary can declare a "foreign adversary" without consulting Congress, and any social media platform with 20% or more ownership by that designated entity can be banned from operating in the US.
- An American citizen who owns 25% or more of a social media platform and is judged to be under the influence of a foreign adversary — even without proof of actual control — can be forced to divest.
- Elon Musk's business ties to China through Tesla make him a plausible target under the law's framework; the Biden administration had already called for investigations of his activities.
- Platforms that cooperated with White House requests to suppress speech labeled disinformation are not targets of the legislation; only those that refused government influence are.
- Rand Paul called it the greatest assault on liberty since the Patriot Act; Gabbard endorsed that characterization.
- The bill also criminalizes VPN use to access a banned platform, which requires surveillance infrastructure to enforce — peeling back the layers leads, in her words, to a genuinely dark and oppressive place.

## Leaving the Democratic Party

- Gabbard resigned as DNC vice chair in 2016 — violating the rule requiring officer neutrality in a primary — to endorse Bernie Sanders, specifically because she wanted to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for her foreign policy record before Democratic voters.
- DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz made unilateral decisions tilting the 2016 primary toward Clinton, often announced via tweet with no consultation with other officers.
- Mainstream media declared Clinton the most qualified candidate in history based on her titles while refusing to examine her interventionist record as Secretary of State — the job a president's commander-in-chief role most directly maps onto.
- She left the Democratic Party entirely because it had become opposed to foundational freedoms: open-borders enforcement, defund-the-police policies, racializing policy through DEI frameworks, and suppression of internal dissent.
- Within the Democratic caucus, challenging the Biden administration's foreign policy means having your reputation destroyed — former colleagues who were reliable anti-war voices have gone silent or retracted.
- She contrasts this with the Republican Party, which she acknowledges also has power-hungry establishment figures but where voices like Trump, Rand Paul, and Bobby Kennedy are at least allowed to challenge those norms publicly.

## Evaluating Biden and Trump

- Gabbard knew Biden personally for years, was friends with his son Beau who served in the National Guard, and considered Biden someone capable of working across differences — but concluded his presidency did the exact opposite of his inauguration pledge to unite the country.
- Obama's 2008 campaign built genuine cross-demographic hope, but he immediately surrounded himself with Washington establishment figures rather than a new generation of reformers, then sided with the national security state over civil liberties when confronted with NSA surveillance disclosures.
- Obama had given Senate floor speeches against the Patriot Act and NSA surveillance before becoming president; once in office, he chose not to reform the programs he had publicly criticized.
- Trump's core strength, in Gabbard's view, is that financial independence from Washington makes him less afraid of losing power than most politicians — he ran on a largely non-interventionist platform in 2016.
- Trump's core weakness was surrounding himself with establishment warmongers — Bolton, Pompeo — who systematically undermined the non-interventionist policies he campaigned on.
- A second Trump term's success would depend entirely on whether he learned from 2016 and built a team of courageous people willing to actually clean out the entrenched bureaucracy.

## Faith, Purpose, and Resilience Under Attack

- Gabbard frames her ability to withstand political attacks as rooted in purpose rather than career ambition — she never thought of her work in city council, the state legislature, or Congress as a political career.
- Her sense of purpose is grounded in Hindu faith and a personal commitment to being of service to God's children, which she describes as her only metric for her own behavior.
- Attacks from former friends, colleagues, and family members — people who turned against her for political reasons — were painful but did not change her direction because her satisfaction is not derived from pleasing those people.
- Hinduism, she explains, is genuinely monotheistic — one God described by many names and characteristics — and non-sectarian by design, with the Bhagavad Gita's teachings applicable regardless of whether one is Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or Hindu.
- Her parents combined Catholic and Episcopalian backgrounds with the Bhagavad Gita; she grew up reading both the New Testament and Hindu scripture as complementary rather than competing sources.
- Bhakti Yoga — developing a loving personal relationship with God — and Karma Yoga — acting in ways that serve others — are the two frameworks from the Gita she applies directly to her political and personal life.

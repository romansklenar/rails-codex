# Keyu Jin: China's Economy, Tariffs, Trade, Trump, Communism & Capitalism | Lex Fridman Podcast #477

Keyu Jin uses her dual insider-outsider perspective as a Chinese-born LSE economist to challenge both Western caricatures of China as a monolithic state and Chinese triumphalism, arguing the country's model is uniquely hybrid and its future depends on structural reforms the political system is resisting.

## Misconceptions about China

- The single biggest Western misconception is that one person or small group runs the entire Chinese economy; in reality it is more economically decentralized than the US.
- Political centralization coexists with economic decentralization — the two are not contradictory in China's model.
- The Chinese relationship with authority is not blind submission but an implicit social contract: deference in exchange for stability, security, and prosperity.
- Entrepreneurialism requires individual agency; millions of Chinese young people see opportunity at scale across a billion-consumer market.
- Economically, China is one of the most capitalist societies Jin has seen — competitive, ambitious, return-maximizing; socially, its fabric remains strongly socialist and communal.
- State enterprises dominate banking and certain strategic sectors, but most economic activity is private and market-driven.

## Education, Meritocracy, and Confucianism

- Confucianism is a moral philosophy prioritizing social harmony, not a religion; it frames saving and education as moral duties, not just practical choices.
- China's civil service examination tradition — selecting officials by standardized test — dates back centuries and reflects deep Confucian meritocratic values.
- Jin's middle school publicly ranked all 800 students after every exam; the shame and ambition this created was considered socially normal.
- Chinese competition is visible and proud; American competition is equally fierce but concealed — Harvard PhD students publicly downplayed their own effort.
- The flaw of Chinese education competition is that it optimizes within the box rather than questioning the box; US education explicitly asks students to challenge authority and invent their own questions.
- Meritocracy in China is eroding: university admission remains relatively fair via standardized testing, but job placement is increasingly connection-dependent.

## Deng Xiaoping's Reforms and the Mayor Economy

- Deng Xiaoping's 1970s "open up and reform" mandate was genuinely shocking to his generation — shifting national focus to the economy rather than ideology was unprecedented.
- Reform succeeded through local-government incentives, not central command: mayors who executed radical reforms were promoted; failure meant removal.
- Special Economic Zones transformed Shenzhen from a fishing village into an export platform and eventually a Chinese-style Silicon Valley.
- Agricultural reforms in the 1980s allowed farmers to keep surplus production for the first time, breaking the collective system.
- China joining the WTO in 2001 was the single largest accelerant of growth; every major reform wave was followed by roughly a decade of strong growth.
- The reform pace has slowed in the last 15 years; the shift from an entrepreneurial state to a safety-first state changed the incentive structure.
- China competed in EVs by running 80 cities simultaneously funding EV companies; wasteful but it generated the industrial push needed in a new sector with no incumbent advantage.
- Environmental targets initially failed because they punished GDP growth; once made a penalizing factor rather than a goal, blue skies returned to Beijing within a few years.
- GDP as the sole local-government yardstick drove over-investment in real estate and infrastructure; consumption was never part of the metric.

## China's Hybrid Economy: Communism, Capitalism, and the State

- China innovates first and regulates after; Europe regulates before companies can innovate — a fundamental difference in approach to emerging markets.
- P2P platforms and financial innovations were allowed to proliferate under the innovate-first model, some beneficial, some disastrous.
- State-owned enterprises dominate energy and national security sectors; beyond those, private companies drive the economy.
- Local governments actively help private companies succeed because their own performance metrics depend on it — the interests are aligned, not opposed.
- Evergrande bought soccer clubs and built EVs; defense companies bought art auction houses — the pre-crackdown era gave private companies too much latitude.
- China is moving from a low-rule-of-law environment toward gradually establishing bankruptcy laws, corruption laws, and market regulation, but the process is incomplete.

## Jack Ma and the Limits of Private Power

- In China, capital must be controlled by politics; in the US, capital controls politics — this is the fundamental structural difference for entrepreneurs.
- Ant Financial was doing banking without bank regulation, creating genuine financial stability grounds for halting its IPO.
- The Jack Ma case signals "don't be too colorful" — not "don't be an entrepreneur"; wealth accumulation is fine, wielding political influence or public visibility is not.
- The Chinese proverb "the tallest tree gets the most wind" captures the operative rule for billionaires.
- Jack Ma's current global roaming is by choice; his generation is deeply grateful to China because Deng Xiaoping's reforms enabled their rise — there is no Soviet-style resentment of broken promises.

## Innovation: Zero-to-One vs. Scale and Diffusion

- The US will lead on zero-to-one breakthroughs for some time; China's competitive advantage is in stages two and three: production, commercialization, and diffusion.
- China's AI Plus program pushes AI adoption into every plausible sector via state support — prioritizing diffusion over invention.
- DeepSeek represents scale-based, cost-cutting innovation that may be as economically powerful as frontier invention — a new model, not a lesser one.
- Chinese companies are problem-solvers by training: the education system gives problems, not blank pages, so they excel at finding solutions, not inventing questions.
- Basic research at Chinese universities is still weaker than at US institutions; intrinsic curiosity-driven scholarship is emerging but not yet culturally embedded.
- IP protection is weak in China and copying is culturally uncontroversial; this will have to change as China becomes an innovation economy with assets worth protecting.
- Huawei, heavily sanctioned, emerged stronger; US engineers who worked there described an intense focus on solution-driven innovation, particularly in Africa and rural deployments.

## DeepSeek and the CHIPS Act Backfire

- DeepSeek happened under conditions of crisis and urgency, not comfort; Jin calls this "crisis innovation" — existential threat accelerates domestic capability.
- When China could import the best chips cheaply, its semiconductor industry stagnated for 20 years; export controls forced domestic development.
- Export controls and CHIPS Act sanctions may have backfired: they motivated a whole-of-nation response analogous to China's Olympic gold-medal mobilization campaigns.
- The gap between China and the US on leading-edge AI is much smaller than export controls were designed to ensure.
- Leverage has a half-life: used once, it motivates substitution; used again, much of the effect is already priced in.
- Historical blockades — the continental system, Spanish-Portuguese naval rivalry — consistently failed to suppress the blocked party and often accelerated the response.

## Tariffs, Trade, and US-China Relations

- China spent five years preparing for Trump's return and his trade policies; the US did not show equivalent preparation.
- China's negotiating principles are equivalence, reciprocity, and realism; they will not lower tariffs unilaterally and view the phase-one deal as having been unrealistic.
- Areas where China can negotiate: opening services to US banks and financial institutions, buying more American goods, e-commerce and data transparency rules.
- Non-negotiable for China: Taiwan and Hong Kong as part of any trade deal, challenges to the state-hybrid-private-sector model, technology and national security matters.
- Tariffs are distortionary and have not closed the US-China trade deficit; the deficit is a macroeconomic phenomenon — the US saves less than it invests — not a trade phenomenon.
- The US-Japan semiconductor competition in the 1980s is the correct analog: the US responded to Japanese dominance by strengthening its own innovation system, not via tariffs, and retook the lead.
- Both the US and China thrived under the US liberal international order; dismantling it for a fragmented, rule-of-jungle world makes both worse off.
- Cultural fluency matters in negotiations: face-saving and respect are vital to Chinese counterparts, and their absence makes otherwise achievable deals harder.

## Taiwan, TSMC, and Geopolitical Risk

- Taiwan's importance is both economic (TSMC as a global semiconductor chokepoint) and emotional for mainland Chinese, who view unification as a patriotic dream.
- China's strategic patience and ambiguity on Taiwan is deliberate policy; military action would be detrimental to China's own interests.
- The one-child policy generation means mainland China's soldiers are typically the only child in their family — the public's tolerance for wartime casualties is lower than often assumed.
- Political risk uncertainty around Taiwan has sharply curtailed investment there despite TSMC's economic centrality.
- China does not want to destroy TSMC either; the semiconductor ecosystem serves Chinese interests too.
- Building a TSMC equivalent outside Taiwan has proven very difficult; decades of cumulative knowledge, skills, and process cannot be quickly replicated.

## One-Child Policy and Demographics

- In Jin's urban Beijing school, 98% of students had no siblings; the only exception was a Uyghur classmate, as ethnic minorities were exempt.
- An unintended benefit: daughters received the same investment as sons for the first time in Chinese history, producing a generation of highly educated women who now fill civil service and corporate roles.
- Chinese families now often prefer daughters over sons because scarce brides have greater bargaining power and can command higher dowry.
- One-child policy is a primary cause of China's high saving rate: single-child families channel all resources into that child, leaving less for consumption.
- The "six wallets" phenomenon: a young couple buying a home can draw on savings from both sets of parents and both sets of grandparents.
- The policy was kept in too long; once relaxed, fertility rates were already structurally too low to recover quickly through incentives alone.
- Post-1990 evidence shows aging economies adopted automation faster and became richer — the demographic panic may be less warranted than assumed if AI and robotics adoption accelerates.

## China's Economic Slowdown and Real Estate Crisis

- Western predictions of Chinese economic collapse have been made four to six times since the 1980s, each time during periods of China's fastest growth.
- China's fundamentals remain intact: skilled human capital, physical capital, macroeconomic stability, political stability — but confidence, consumer spending, and private investment are weak.
- China is a $10,000 per capita income country producing frontier AI and competing with US tech companies — the first time in history a middle-income country has done this.
- The real estate crackdown ("housing is to be lived in, not speculated") removed speculative investment but also collapsed two foundational pillars: local government fiscal revenues and household wealth.
- Local government finances depended heavily on land sales to property developers; when real estate collapsed, municipal finances shrank dramatically.
- Chinese household wealth is primarily stored in real estate, not equities; falling property prices made consumers feel poor and cut consumption.
- Unwinding a property-led growth model typically takes three to five years in a good scenario and up to ten in a bad one; where China currently sits is uncertain.

# Irving Finkel: Deciphering Secrets of Ancient Civilizations & Flood Myths | Lex Fridman Podcast #487

A 45-year British Museum curator demolishes the orthodoxy that ancient peoples were primitive, insisting they were cognitively indistinguishable from us while revealing how a single Babylonian clay tablet rewrote the prehistory of both writing and the Biblical flood.

## Origins of Writing

- The earliest evidence of writing dates to approximately 3500 BC in Mesopotamia, between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, where clay was the ubiquitous building and writing material.
- Writing's defining invention is not pictography but phonetic encoding: a sign that carries an agreed sound value, enabling any language to be recorded — the equivalent of a gramophone record made of clay.
- The received Assyriological view holds that pictographs came first and phonetic signs second; Finkel finds this implausible and suspects the phonetic leap predates our earliest archaeological evidence by a very long time.
- His controversial alternative theory: pictographic signs in early Sumer are the tail-end of a long pan-regional communication system used by merchants who didn't share a language, and phonetic writing was always in parallel use on perishable materials.
- Early scribes rapidly invented lexicography alongside writing — systematic lists of everything made of wood, of reeds, of colors, gods, and countries — which standardized the signs and kept the system learnable across three millennia.
- A trained Babylonian scribe in the 3rd or 2nd century BC could read tablets from two thousand years earlier because lexicographic rigor was jealously maintained from the outset.

## Göbekli Tepe and the Age of Writing

- Finkel points to an obscure color plate in the Göbekli Tepe excavation photographs showing a round green stamp seal, ca. 9000 BC, with hieroglyphic-style signs carved on its flat face — a form designed to press impressions into clay or sealing material.
- His inference: if a stamp seal exists, a writing system exists, pushing literate administration back roughly 6,000 years before the Sumerian evidence.
- The standard argument that writing arose because complex urban administration required it applies with equal force to Göbekli Tepe, whose architecture demanded organized labor, measured plans, and material procurement at a scale requiring coordination.
- He invokes the Sherlock Holmes principle — "you can infer the Niagara Falls from a raindrop" — to justify reading an entire writing system from a single seal artefact.
- Indus Valley seals are a parallel case: small inscribed stones for ratification purposes almost certainly reflect a larger writing tradition on palm leaf, a material still used in parts of India today.
- Inertia is as powerful as evolution; assuming ancient practices must differ from modern ones in the same region is a fallacy he regards as endemic to the field.

## How Cuneiform Works

- "Cuneiform" is 19th-century Latin for "wedge-shaped" (cuneus = wedge), coined when excavators at Assyrian sites first catalogued the triangular mark clusters on tablets and reliefs.
- The system is syllabic, not alphabetic: consonants cannot be written alone; they appear only as CV or VC pairs (e.g., "ba," "ab") built around four vowels, giving every consonant a family of around eight signs.
- Words are written by stringing syllable signs together without spaces between words, requiring the reader to parse boundaries from grammatical and contextual knowledge.
- One sign routinely carries multiple sound values and multiple meanings (multivalency), because signs originated as logograms for Sumerian words that were probably tonally differentiated; the tonal distinctions vanished but the separate sign values remained.
- Sumerian is agglutinative — a central root with prefixes (Mu, Ba, E) and suffixes stacked around it — producing long verb forms that pack tense, aspect, transitivity, and person into a single word.
- Sumerian belongs to no known language family; the relatives that must have once existed across Central or East Asia are entirely gone, leaving cuneiform as the sole preserved member of an otherwise extinct linguistic phylum.
- Learning cuneiform at university requires mastering two unrelated languages simultaneously (Sumerian and Akkadian), plus sign lists, grammars, and a dictionary that took decades of international collaboration to produce.

## Decipherment

- The Behistun inscription, carved halfway up a mountain in Iran by King Darius, provided the trilingual key to cuneiform: the same text in Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian.
- Old Persian, still related to living Persian, was deciphered first; repeated royal title formulae ("I am Darius, great king, king of kings, son of...") gave anchor points to match against the parallel Babylonian column.
- The discovery that Babylonian was a Semitic language was pivotal: scholars immediately cross-referenced Arabic and Hebrew dictionaries to match word roots, dramatically accelerating decipherment.
- Finkel disputes Henry Rawlinson's title "Father of Assyriology," calling him the "Stepfather" — his initial published account was largely wrong.
- The true credit, in Finkel's view, belongs to Edward Hincks, an Irish country clergyman in Killyleagh who first worked out that cuneiform signs are multivalent, a discovery that unlocked the system's logic.
- The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary — started in the 1920s, produced over decades by most of the world's leading Assyriologists, filling a shelf-length of volumes — is described as America's greatest cultural achievement, rivaled only by the electric guitar.

## Translation and the Limits of Language

- No word in one language precisely equates a word in another; the best translation is always an approximation that shifts with literary genre, so the same Akkadian verb means differently in a proverb versus a letter.
- Akkadian lacks grammatically encoded modal verbs ("could," "might," "should"), yet Finkel argues the language must have expressed modality somehow — perhaps through vowel lengthening — because its literary sophistication is otherwise inexplicable.
- The consequence is that most colleagues mistranslate omen texts as stating certainties ("if X, then Y will happen") when the professional diviner could never have committed to certainties without risking his head if the prediction failed.
- Divination literature was inherently probabilistic: the diviner's job was to tell the king what the sign "could" portend and to deploy ritual to avert it, making Babylonian divination closer to risk management than prophecy.
- Medical texts follow the same modal logic: "you should get better" rather than "you will get better," the same hedge every doctor uses today.
- The cuneiform corpus represents only the output of a small literate elite — the Babylonian equivalent of Oxford and Cambridge — so every generalization about ancient Mesopotamian thought is skewed by the narrow channel through which it arrived.

## Gods and Religion

- The Mesopotamian pantheon was hierarchical: three senior gods (Anu, Enlil, Ea) presided over hundreds of lesser deities assigned specialties and positions as staff in divine households.
- Every newborn was placed under the tutelage of a specific god, with the family or royal lineage determining which deity served as personal protector.
- Mesopotamians did not "believe in" gods or debate their existence; they took them for granted the way we take gravity for granted — a different epistemic relationship than modern religious faith.
- The same was true of ghosts: cuneiform texts show no sign that anyone ever questioned whether ghosts existed; they were simply part of the landscape, and the dead were buried under courtyards with holes left for food and liquid offerings.
- Finkel argues that monotheism introduced religious evil into the world by making belief exclusive — "I'm right and you're wrong" — whereas polytheism allowed multiple coexisting cults with no mechanism for persecution.
- Sleeping under open skies in southern Iraq, surrounded by stars with no light pollution, made the presence of gods an immediate sensory fact rather than an act of faith, an experiential difference that ancient texts reflect.

## The Ark Tablet and Flood Myth

- Finkel identified the Ark Tablet — approximately eight inches by three inches of Babylonian clay, ca. 1700 BC — when a member of the public brought it to the British Museum; he recognized it as a flood narrative almost immediately.
- The tablet describes the god Ea (the third of the divine triumvirate) secretly warning Atra-Hasis to build a boat to preserve life, and provides specific materials and quantities — a building blueprint rather than a general narrative.
- The revolutionary detail: the ark is round, a giant coracle, reflecting the actual round reed-and-bitumen boats used on Mesopotamian rivers, not the coffin-shaped vessel of popular imagination.
- The Babylonian motivation for the flood is overpopulation noise, interpreted by Finkel as a euphemism for demographic overpressure — the gods then institute barren women and infertile men as population controls, a Malthusian solution.
- In 1872, George Smith at the British Museum found the Gilgamesh version of the flood, which contains the three-bird release sequence (the survivor releases birds one by one until one doesn't return) — an exact literary parallel to Genesis that proved textual dependence rather than independent invention.
- The Ark Tablet predates the biblical text by at least a thousand years, establishing Mesopotamian primacy and supporting Finkel's theory that Judean exiles in Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar absorbed and recycled Babylonian cosmological narratives into what became the Hebrew Bible.
- Finkel dismisses Graham Hancock's Younger Dryas global-flood hypothesis as "negligible," treating the flood myth as a literary device rooted in real but localized Mesopotamian river catastrophes amplified across generations.
- A one-third scale replica was built in Kerala using medieval Arab boat-building specialists, following the tablet's proportions exactly; it floated, leaked slightly (which Finkel notes is normal for any wooden boat), and proved the blueprint was functionally sound.

## The Royal Game of Ur

- The Royal Game of Ur board, dating to approximately 2600 BC, was found by Leonard Woolley in royal graves at Ur alongside pieces and dice, indicating the game was considered essential for the afterlife.
- Boards in the same idiosyncratic 20-square layout appeared across Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Crete over nearly 3,000 years, making it one of the most geographically and chronologically widespread games in human history.
- Tutankhamun's tomb contained two or three boards with pieces, confirming the game reached Egyptian pharaohs by the mid-second millennium BC.
- The game spread without written rules and across language barriers, transmitted by merchants and travelers who picked it up in taverns and carried the concept home.
- Finkel reconstructed the rules from a second-century BC cuneiform tablet in the British Museum that described piece names, types, and throw values — working backward from this late version to the earlier game.
- The game is a race game balancing dice-driven chance with tactical blocking strategy, placing it between pure-luck Snakes and Ladders and pure-strategy chess — the same equilibrium that makes backgammon enduringly popular.
- The game is now played online and in Iraqi cafes, having been revived largely through Finkel's reconstruction.

## The British Museum

- The British Museum holds approximately 130,000 cuneiform tablets; millions more remain unexcavated in Iraqi soil.
- Finkel frames the Museum's mission as representing all of human achievement without favoritism toward any culture, religion, or nation — "the human species" rather than any subset of it.
- Its second constituency is the unborn: artifacts are held in trust for future generations whose interpretive frameworks will reveal meanings invisible to contemporary scholars, making storage itself a scholarly act.
- He distinguishes the British Museum from the Louvre (a museum of art) and the Met (also art-focused): the British Museum is a museum of ideas and human struggle, not primarily of aesthetic objects.
- The Nineveh library of Ashurbanipal, discovered in the 1850s in disarray, almost certainly represents duplicates and discards, not the full collection — Finkel argues the Babylonian conquerors carted the real tablets home, since they shared the writing system and language.

## Human Nature Across Millennia

- Finkel's core claim: put ancient Mesopotamians on a modern bus in the same clothes and you would not identify them as ancient; human cognitive and emotional hardware is unchanged.
- Neanderthals over 800,000 years in Europe, surviving ice ages, raising children, and cooperating in hunts, almost certainly had language — the apparatus and circumstances both required it.
- Cave paintings of running antelopes in accurate color demonstrate individual genius ("Rembrandts") existed in prehistory; Finkel speculates a single itinerant artist may have been responsible for many European cave sites.
- The accumulation of oral literature — stories told by firelight about floods, battles, famous people, and the invention of fire — is the substrate from which written literature emerged; the Gilgamesh epic's formulaic speaker-attribution phrases ("Gilgamesh opened his mouth to speak") are frozen echoes of oral performance.
- Finkel views the modern digital world as analogous to an addictive drug that reduces human vitality, degrades language use, and substitutes for genuine experience in ways people don't recognize until the dependency is entrenched.
- The richness of English — its vast vocabulary invisible to most speakers who never open a full Oxford English Dictionary — mirrors the richness of Akkadian, and both languages are diminished when vocabulary contracts, because the quality of thought is bounded by available words.

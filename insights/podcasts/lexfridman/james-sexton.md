# James Sexton: Divorce Lawyer on Marriage, Relationships, Sex, Lies & Love | Lex Fridman Podcast #396

A battle-hardened divorce lawyer who weaponizes intimacy in court turns out to be one of the most earnest advocates for love, arguing from 20+ years of ringside seats that disconnection is the only real enemy.

## Why Marriages Fail

- Disconnection is the root cause of divorce — cheating, money, and substance abuse are downstream symptoms, not the source.
- Disconnection follows the Tom Wolfe bankruptcy pattern: it happens very slowly and then all at once.
- Small omissions — stopping the favorite granola, dropping a sexual practice — are the earliest signals, but couples wait for a catastrophic event before addressing them.
- Cheating is the "all at once" moment; the slow drift that preceded it is the real story.
- Media tropes of eye-rolling spouses and emasculated husbands normalize contempt and model exactly the wrong behavior.
- Successful couples are "thick as thieves" — they publicly defend each other, share the same corner, and radiate the feeling that they genuinely like each other.
- A partner who says "you screwed up, but let's go, I know you have it in you" functions as a genuine superpower in a world already saturated with criticism.

## The Role of Small Gestures and Communication

- Feeling someone's love and knowing they love you are different things; the feeling comes from tiny, often unnamed acts — bringing the newspaper to the door, remembering a disliked record.
- Once you name the small gesture, it loses spontaneity; but when a pattern stops, naming it while it's starting is far better than waiting for the dam to break.
- Fearless communication means saying "this feels like something to me — am I wrong?" rather than suppressing the signal until a crisis forces the conversation.
- The granola-and-blowjobs heuristic: each was stopped for ostensibly good reasons, but neither partner said anything, and the accumulation became the relationship's undoing.
- At a wedding, Sexton never watches the bride — he watches the groom watching the bride, because the adoration on the groom's face is the best predictor of what the marriage will look like.

## Vulnerability, Sexuality, and Authenticity

- Hiding a significant part of yourself from a partner means any love they express is directed at the curated version — you will never actually feel it.
- The closet analogy: gay men who spent decades hiding eventually advise against it, even when the hidden years also produced marriages and children they value.
- Sexton's jiu-jitsu framing: every move creates both opportunity and vulnerability; a marriage where both partners are in "50-50 guard doing nothing" produces no forward progress.
- Unshared sexual desires tend to result in either suppression (which breeds resentment) or external outlets (which become betrayals) — neither outcome is neutral.
- The devil's principal function, in Sexton's quasi-theological view, is convincing people they are so flawed that no one could love the real them.

## Infidelity: Five Types and Their Mechanics

- The "soulmate" affair — "I found the person I'm supposed to be with" — is the most common type Sexton encounters and the hardest for the betrayed partner to metabolize.
- The "push out of the closet" — closeted gay or lesbian individuals conducting same-sex affairs — has declined as marriage equality expanded social acceptance.
- The "mistake" — a moment of poor impulse control with no intent to leave — is, in Sexton's view, the saddest type because it is most disproportionate in its consequences.
- Sexton rarely sees genuinely happy couples cheat; infidelity almost always maps onto pre-existing disconnection, even when the betrayed partner was acting in good faith.
- If Facebook were redesigned as an infidelity machine, it would look exactly like Facebook; as of 2023, Sexton would update this to Meta across all its platforms.
- Emotional affairs begin with proximity and small benign contacts — "Oh, I saw you went on vacation, where did you stay?" — not with explicit intent.
- When a man discovers infidelity, the first question is "did you have sex with them?"; when a woman discovers it, the first question is "do you love her?" — the two fears are structurally different.

## The Courtroom as Human Chess

- Sexton describes his job as "full context storytelling" and "weaponizing intimacy" — he must make his client the hero and the opposing party the villain while maintaining credibility with a judge who knows no one is all good or all bad.
- The "8 Mile strategy": surface damaging information about your own client on direct examination, depriving opposing counsel of their Perry Mason moment.
- Family law is bench trial only — no juries — so every argument is aimed at a single human being in a black robe who carries their own parenting history and marital assumptions into every ruling.
- Judges are fully human: one interrupted expert testimony about child abuse to interrogate whether spanking counts, visibly processing her own household's practices on the stand.
- Sexton's corollary to Occam's Razor: "Never attribute to strategy that which can be attributed to stupidity or laziness" — he spent years reading tactical depth into opposing counsel who had simply forgotten to file.
- In negotiations, the Gary Oldman "Chinese food" scene from True Romance is the canonical lesson: the party who appears unbothered controls the room.
- Most experienced divorce lawyers skip the gunfight — they map the entire legal battle in their heads, see who wins, and agree to the outcome before a shot is fired, like Miyamoto Musashi's two swordsmen.

## Cost and Complexity of Divorce

- The least expensive divorce Sexton has seen cost $3,500 — two people who resolved everything at the kitchen table and just needed it memorialized legally.
- The most expensive: clients who have paid $2–3 million in counsel fees, usually driven by complex custody fights, international child abduction under the Hague Convention, or obscured high-net-worth assets.
- High net-worth structures — an LLC owns the home, a trust owns the LLC, the client holds a beneficial interest — were designed for tax efficiency but become nightmares to value and divide.
- The Jeff Bezos divorce, in its early stages, had the potential to move Amazon stock, illustrating that financial complexity in a divorce can have market-scale consequences.
- Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's multi-year custody dispute, with the best California lawyers money can buy, proves you cannot buy resolution to a parenting conflict.

## Prenuptial Agreements

- Sexton's unambiguous position: everyone who marries legally should have a prenup.
- A prenup is not a prediction of divorce; it is the same category of preparation as writing a will or buying life insurance.
- Most people undergo the most legally significant act of their lives without any understanding of the rights and obligations it creates — a prenup forces that education to happen at the start rather than in a divorce lawyer's office.
- The simplest effective prenup is "yours, mine, and ours": what's in your name is yours, what's in my name is mine, joint property splits 50-50.
- Prenups are not filed with any court and never appear in public records — celebrities who claim on television that they have no prenup frequently have one sitting in Sexton's office.
- Fidelity clauses (financial penalties for cheating) are discouraged: they create expensive definitional and evidentiary fights without actually deterring infidelity.
- Sunset clauses are also discouraged: a provision that voids the prenup after 15 years forces a painful "do I still want to be married?" calculation at year 14 and a half, exactly when a new company worth $100 million may have entered the picture.
- Kevin Costner's first divorce cost him heavily in asset division; his second marriage included a well-crafted prenup that largely held, with disputes limited to child and spousal support.

## Co-Parenting and the Long Game

- Every custody battle contains a straight line to the future: either the couple stands together for a toast at their child's wedding, or they must be separated by the shrimp table.
- For 17+ years, Sexton has sent his ex-wife a Happy Mother's Day text every year affirming that he is glad she is the mother of his children.
- Sexton drafted a clause requiring parents to help young children buy a small gift or make a card for the co-parent's birthday — a provision he calls a no-brainer that a significant portion of opposing counsel refused to sign.
- Parental alienation is almost never explicit; the damage is done through a slight grimace when handing a phone to a child, or saying "remember, he's not your dad" after learning about a new partner.
- Weaponizing a child against a co-parent requires the parent to believe they are protecting the child — the self-permission mechanism is what makes it persistent and hard to prove.
- "Most victims of intimate partner abuse don't call the cops" — vacation photos and absence of police reports are not evidence of a non-abusive marriage.

## Honesty, Lying, and the Law of Puffery

- The law permits "mere puffery" — hyperbolic statements that no reasonable person would take as literal truth — while prohibiting material misrepresentation of fact; Sexton applies this distinction to relationships.
- Honesty and candor are not synonyms: "That blue dress doesn't flatter you the way the other one does" is honest; "yes, you look fat" is honest but needlessly brutal.
- A real apology names the specific action, acknowledges the impact, and expresses genuine regret — "I'm sorry you got upset" is a bullshit apology.
- You lie to your children constantly: about Santa, about death, about whether the situation is serious; refusing to say anything positive about a co-parent out of commitment to "honesty" is not principled, it is self-serving.
- Text has the permanence of writing and the impulsivity of speech — a toxic combination that Sexton reads daily in evidence packets, and that looks far worse out of context than it felt in the moment.

## Productivity, Daily Routine, and the Practice of Law

- Sexton wakes naturally at 4:00 AM, checks for client emergencies, drinks black espresso, works out for an hour (weights or cardio, modified post-L5-S1 herniation with a previous max deadlift of 485 lbs), takes a sauna and cold plunge, then drafts legal documents from roughly 6:00 to 9:00 AM.
- Court typically runs 9:00 AM to noon; on trial days, the lunch break is consumed by witness prep and damage control, not lunch.
- The night before trial: near-sleepless. The night after a trial ends: the deepest sleep he knows.
- He bills in six-minute increments (tenths of an hour) and told his son, now a district attorney, that the feeling of "all work done" disappears from a lawyer's life permanently.
- He goes to bed by 7:30–8:00 PM; on New Year's Eve, he has never seen 9:00 PM.

## Jiu-Jitsu as Philosophy

- Sexton is a seven-year brown belt under Marcelo Garcia, training since he got divorced in his mid-career; he chose his Manhattan apartment for its proximity to Marcelo's academy.
- Jiu-jitsu taught him that every movement creates both opportunity and vulnerability simultaneously — the structural parallel to how emotional exposure works in relationships.
- His best jiu-jitsu teacher is Paul Shriner, who teaches conceptual frameworks first and technique second — the same pedagogy Sexton uses when framing cases for judges.
- He trained at 5:00 AM with law enforcement officers coming off night shifts; those sessions were, in his words, "heaven."
- Sexton offered a public apology to Gordon Ryan on the podcast for obnoxious comments made on Facebook roughly eight or nine years earlier, during a period when his mother was dying and his judgment was poor — a demonstration of his stated belief that a real apology names the specific wrong.

## Love, Loss, and the Infinite Capacity of the Heart

- 56% of marriages end in divorce; 84% of divorced people remarry within five years — the data show not that marriage is broken, but that the human drive toward pair bonding is nearly impossible to extinguish.
- The opposite of love is not hate (both are passionate) — it is indifference; anger that persists four or five years after a divorce is still, technically, love.
- His dog analogy: when his first dog died he swore never again; a friend called asking him to watch a rescue dog for one night; he kept the dog, now 13, with cloudy eyes and bad knees. "I wouldn't change that for the world."
- Sexton proposes — only half-jokingly — that psilocybin-assisted mediation sessions, with individual and joint components, could be transformative for divorcing couples by bypassing the adversarial frame and reinstating empathy.
- His father is a Vietnam veteran alcoholic who got sober in Sexton's 40s; Sexton credits the adult-child-of-alcoholic personality traits (desire for control, discipline) as core to both his professional success and his emotional attunement.
- Closing principle: "You can't regret being with that person if you love your kids, because those kids don't exist without that person."

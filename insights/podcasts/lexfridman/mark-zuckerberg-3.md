# Mark Zuckerberg: First Interview in the Metaverse | Lex Fridman Podcast #398

## Codec Avatars and the Technology of Presence

- This episode is conducted entirely inside the Metaverse — Zuckerberg and Fridman are hundreds of miles apart but appear to each other as photorealistic 3D avatars with spatial audio using Meta's Codec Avatar research project.
- Codec Avatars work by scanning a person's face and body across many different expressions, building a computer model compressed into a "codec," which the headset then reads in real time and sends as an encoded stream rather than raw video — making it more bandwidth-efficient than transmitting a full 3D video scene.
- Fridman traveled to Pittsburgh for the full scanning process, which took hours; Zuckerberg's goal is to replace that with a two-to-three-minute smartphone scan where the user waves the phone in front of their face, says a few sentences, and makes a range of expressions.
- The avatar captures millimeter-level facial detail — wrinkles, freckles, color variation, asymmetry, and especially the subtle movements of the corners of the eyes — which Zuckerberg argues are responsible for most of the emotional communication in human interaction.
- Both Zuckerberg and Fridman noted the system has already crossed the uncanny valley: the experience felt like being in the same room with no sense of wrongness, which Fridman described as making him nearly emotional.
- Zuckerberg acknowledged per-person tuning remains unsolved: different people have different natural ranges of expression, and the avatar must be calibrated so that Zuckerberg's physically restrained smile, for example, actually reflects how happy he is rather than clamping his expression to his face's default.
- The avatars are temporally frozen at the time of capture — Zuckerberg noted his avatar had slightly shorter hair and was clean-shaven even if he hadn't physically shaved, raising questions about identity drift between capture and use.
- Full-body Codec Avatars require substantially more compute than face-only versions; the current roadmap prioritizes high-resolution face rendering because millimeter movements of the eyebrows carry far more communicative signal than inch-level arm movements.
- Zuckerberg described plans to roll out Codec Avatar scanning progressively: first to more people for scans, then integrating the avatars into individual Meta apps over the next few years, without a single moment of mass release.

## Quest 3 and Mixed Reality

- Quest 3 launched in fall 2023 at $500 — one-third the price of Quest Pro ($1,500) — while offering mixed reality camera resolution described as "multiple times better" than Quest Pro's.
- Quest 3 runs a custom Qualcomm next-generation chipset built in partnership with Meta, which was not available when Quest Pro shipped; as a result, Quest 3 has a more powerful chip than Quest Pro despite being the non-Pro product.
- Quest 3 is 40% thinner than its predecessor, improving comfort during extended wear.
- Zuckerberg described Quest 3 as "the first mainstream mixed reality device" — capable of superimposing digital objects on the physical world in a way that millions of consumers will actually use.
- Pass-through mixed reality on Quest 3 is not simply camera video — it requires multiple cameras to reconstruct 3D space, an AI model to remap that space to each user's specific eye position (which varies person to person), and real-time rendering of the combined scene.
- Zuckerberg cited a concrete comfort benefit of mixed reality for VR games: users can see their physical environment while playing a shooter or fitness app, eliminating the anxiety of accidentally hitting furniture or walls when swinging their arms.
- The demo Fridman tried included hand tracking without controllers, including a piano-learning experience played on a real table surface with zero visible latency — Zuckerberg credited faster-than-expected progress on hand recognition.
- Zuckerberg predicted that by the end of the decade people would walk into rooms that contain as many holograms as physical objects, enabled by normal-looking glasses rather than headsets.

## Vision for the Metaverse and the Blended World

- Zuckerberg's core argument is that the "real world" is no longer just the physical world — it is the combination of physical and digital, and current screen-based computing artificially separates the two by forcing people to access digital content through a small rectangle.
- He described a near-future meeting scenario where some attendees are physically present, others appear as Codec Avatar holograms superimposed on the physical room, and an AI avatar of a team member named "Bob" participates alongside both — all indistinguishable in appearance.
- Zuckerberg cited the remote work debate as a key test case: present video conferencing does not deliver the trust-building and relationship-forming benefits of physical co-presence, but photorealistic spatial presence could get close enough to allow genuinely distributed teams.
- He argued that screens and TVs are fundamentally non-physical devices that require humans to sit still, which conflicts with how people are wired — the goal of spatial computing is to let the digital layer exist in the physical world where people move around.
- Zuckerberg raised an open question about whether people will ultimately prefer photorealistic avatars long-term, or whether — once presence is established — they will migrate toward expressive, stylized, or non-humanoid self-representations that feel more expressive than their physical face.
- Internal Meta experiments showed users have no psychological friction mixing photorealistic and cartoon avatars in the same scene, and no issue having a photorealistic person stand next to a cartoonish one.
- He described holograms as superior to physical objects for many use cases: any screen, book, artwork, board game, or ping pong table could exist as an instantiable-and-dismissible hologram, making physical accumulation of objects increasingly optional.

## Meta AI Personas and the AI Layer

- Meta's base assistant is called "Meta AI" — a plain, neutral, factual AI with no face or distinct personality, available for chat inside any Meta product thread.
- Alongside Meta AI, Meta built a set of distinct AI personas using cultural figures as actors: Snoop Dogg plays a dungeon master in a text-based adventure AI, with Zuckerberg noting internally it was the most-loved AI in testing.
- Zuckerberg distinguished between personas (where Snoop Dogg plays a character and is not literally "Snoop Dogg AI") and true creator replicas (which require that the AI not say anything the creator would disavow and represent their actual knowledge base).
- A platform called AI Studio is in development to allow any user or creator to build their own AI character "almost like they create any other UGC content" — analogous to posting a video or creating a profile.
- Creator-replica AIs — where the AI can credibly represent a specific person such as Lex Fridman — require much harder model reliability work than new-character AIs; Zuckerberg said these would not ship in 2023 but expected some rollout in 2024.
- For businesses, Zuckerberg described AI-powered contact interfaces that let customers interact naturally with a small business without the business staffing a phone line — covering product issues, reservations, and purchases.
- He framed the overall AI strategy as deliberately distributed: rather than one superintelligent AI, the goal is many specialized AI agents that empower individuals to accomplish specific personal and professional goals.
- Zuckerberg raised the near-term possibility of AI personas embodied as Codec Avatars in the Metaverse — "Bob the AI engineer" showing up in a meeting as a photorealistic avatar indistinguishable in appearance from a human attendee.

## Llama 2 and Open Source AI

- Zuckerberg said on the previous Fridman podcast they had debated whether to open source Llama 2; he confirmed they released it and described the reception as "way more downloads and usage than I would've even expected, and I was pretty optimistic."
- After a thorough red-teaming process, Zuckerberg concluded the value of releasing Llama 2 as an open foundation model significantly outweighs the risks.
- Llama 2 itself is not a consumer product — it is infrastructure; Meta's current priority is fine-tuning Llama 2 branches into consumer-facing products targeting hundreds of millions or eventually billions of users.
- Zuckerberg confirmed Meta is training future foundation models but declined to give a timeline for the next release, noting it would require the same red-team and open-source debate process as Llama 2.
- He expressed hope the next foundation model will also be open-sourced but said they are "still somewhat early" in training it and it would not ship that month.

## Identity, Death, and the Philosophy of Digital Presence

- Lex Fridman's first emotional response to the Codec Avatar experience was imagining using it to talk to deceased loved ones — Zuckerberg responded that norms around this are unsettled, noting it could be therapeutic for grief or potentially unhealthy in excess.
- Meta already has protocols for handling dead users' social media profiles: accounts are memorialized so families retain access to public content, but private messages are never handed over even to next of kin.
- Zuckerberg used the avatar gap — his avatar reflects his appearance at time of scan, not today — to open a broader philosophical question: which version of a fluctuating physical body counts as "you," and whether people will want to idealize or accurately represent themselves in their avatars.
- Fridman raised the question of digital identity directly: if most of your interactions are mediated through a digital avatar, are you the entity controlling the avatar or the avatar itself?
- Zuckerberg predicted social scientists, psychologists, and philosophers will have substantial new material to work through as photorealistic avatars become widespread: perceptions of self and others will shift in ways that are hard to model from first principles.
- He argued the modern "real world" already includes too much digital content for it to be siloed to a small screen, and the physical world is too important to abandon — the solution is coherent blending rather than choosing one over the other.
- On ethics and harm in the Metaverse: Zuckerberg said the test is whether an action causes damage to others, not whether it would be illegal in the physical world — shooting a friend in a game lobby causes no harm and needs no restriction, while anonymous toxic behavior that degrades trust does need structural solutions.
- He noted that anonymity in the Metaverse weakens the "repeat game" incentives that enforce good behavior in physical settings (e.g., paying a restaurant bill because you'll return), creating new categories of harm that require new governance approaches.

## The Future of Human Connection

- Zuckerberg described the metaverse's core thesis as "giving people the ability to feel like you're present with someone" — conveying social and psychological benefits of physical co-presence (intimacy, nonverbal communication, trust) without requiring physical co-location.
- He traced Meta's evolution through content formats: text-first (Facebook profiles were mostly lists), then photos, then video — arguing immersive presence is the clear next step in a multi-decade trend toward richer self-expression.
- Zuckerberg's personal framing for why he cares about AR/VR: he believes this will be "by far the most human and social computing platform that has ever existed" — not because it is digital, but because it is physical-digital and moves with you.
- He acknowledged the limitation of explaining Metaverse experiences in 2D: most VR experiences feel more profound from inside than they look from outside via a screen capture, but Codec Avatars may be an exception where the photorealism translates even to a flat recording.
- Fridman summarized the philosophical shift: what makes an experience real is the conscious subjective quality of it, not the physics of shared space — and the Metaverse delivers the conscious quality of physical presence while "breaking physics" on the location requirement.

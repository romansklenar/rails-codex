# Ben Shapiro vs Destiny Debate: Politics, Jan 6, Israel, Ukraine & Wokeism | Lex Fridman Podcast #410

A 2.5-hour structured debate between two of the internet's most skilled partisan debaters that reveals how much substantive agreement exists between a principled conservative and a fact-grounded liberal once tribal signaling is removed.

## Conservative vs Liberal Foundations

- Shapiro defines conservatism around three pillars: socially conservative family structure (Edmund Burke's "little platoons"), free markets and property rights, and a hawkish foreign policy premised on adversarial international actors.
- Shapiro's philosophical foundation is subsidiarity: local governments can do more because they have higher homogeneity and consent; the more you abstract up to the federal level, the more divisive any action becomes.
- Destiny defines liberalism not as preference for big government per se, but as using government instrumentally to ensure everyone can achieve their potential — funding programs insofar as they serve that goal, not taxing wealth as punishment.
- Destiny explicitly rejects the Democratic tendency to demonize wealth and billionaires; he supports taxing the rich only as a means to fund specific programs, not as an end in itself.
- Both agree human nature is neither wholly good nor bad, that individuals have meaningful agency, and that government cannot rectify every imbalance — their split is on which imbalances merit intervention.
- Shapiro invokes Thomas Sowell's concept of "cosmic justice" — the quest to rectify all life's inequalities — as a trap government is structurally incapable of achieving and typically worsens.

## Education and Family Structure

- Shapiro argues the single largest determinant of educational outcomes is two-parent household presence, citing Roland Fryer's research, over funding, technology, or facilities.
- Destiny concedes the point but calls it the "conservative merry-go-round" — pointing to family structure as the root problem without proposing any actionable policy path to fix it.
- Shapiro's direct prescription: don't have children outside of marriage, a norm that held for most of American history including via "shotgun marriages."
- LAUSD spends tens of thousands of dollars per student and produces poor outcomes, which Shapiro uses to challenge the premise that school funding is the binding constraint.
- Both agree on marginal utility framing: the first $1,000 per student in baseline spending may yield large returns; additional spending beyond a threshold does not.
- Shapiro accepts that states or localities voting for school lunches or air conditioning is legitimate — his objection is treating these as solutions to the core structural problem rather than deck chairs on the Titanic.
- Destiny links marriage rates to economic stability and career formation, arguing people delay marriage because they lack financial security to move out, not because of moral failure; Shapiro counters that marriage rates and economic conditions were inversely correlated historically.
- Shapiro predicts that demographic trends favor religious communities that marry early and have four-plus children, making the "arc of history moves away from marriage" claim empirically dubious over long time horizons.

## Trump vs Biden

- Shapiro grades Trump's first term foreign policy as significantly better than Biden's given the state of the world in January 2024, and Trump's pre-COVID economy as solid — median income up ~$6,000, unemployment at historic lows.
- Shapiro separates Trump's rhetoric — which he describes as "he's said a lot of shit" and compares to tinnitus that the brain adjusts to — from policy performance, calling these independent variables.
- Destiny credits Biden with passing the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, and American Rescue Plan through a 50-50 Senate, while Trump passed no major legislation beyond the 2017 tax cuts with full congressional control.
- Shapiro's rebuttal: Republican presidents are measured by legislation passed, but their goal is to pass less legislation, not more — the metric itself is partisan.
- Both agree Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal was a foreign policy blemish, but Destiny argues the Doha Accords negotiated by Trump — which excluded the Afghan military — constrained Biden to 2,500 troops with no good options.
- Shapiro attributes Biden's inflation to continued post-COVID fiscal stimulus after vaccines were widely available by April–May 2021, arguing COVID was no longer a valid excuse for deficit spending by mid-2021.
- Shapiro identifies Biden's OSHA-administered vaccine mandate on 80 million Americans and attempted student debt cancellation (which Biden acknowledged was illegal, then pursued anyway) as examples of executive overreach exceeding anything Trump attempted.

## Foreign Policy and Iran

- Shapiro's central foreign policy thesis: the Middle East operates on a logic where weakness signals that aggression is an appropriate response — diplomacy with the Ayatollah is structurally impossible because Iran's interests are incompatible with Israel's existence.
- Biden's early Middle East moves Shapiro identifies as counterproductive: appointing Robert Malley (later implicated in taking Iranian money through proxies) to negotiate the Iran deal, delisting Houthis as a terrorist organization, and lifting sanctions — all within the first months of the administration.
- Shapiro argues Iran orchestrated the October 7 Hamas attack specifically to disrupt the near-complete normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that was being pre-negotiated under Biden after two years of reorientation.
- Destiny agrees Iran is the number one destabilizing force in the Middle East but argues for a diplomatic path involving nuclear inspections and economic normalization, citing Egypt's peace with Israel as evidence that even wartime enemies can normalize.
- Shapiro's counter: Egypt-Israel peace required Sadat — a leader willing to come to the table — and Iran has never signaled willingness to accept Israel's existence; every Iranian proxy explicitly calls for destruction of both Israel and America.
- Both agree the 2003 Iraq invasion was a Republican-driven catastrophe that destabilized the entire region, empowered Iran by removing the Sunni counterweight, and seeded the conditions for ISIS — Shapiro does not dispute this.
- Shapiro supports the Biden administration's Houthi strikes in the Red Sea / Bab-el-Mandeb as necessary and well-explained in realpolitik terms: Houthi attacks have nearly doubled global shipping costs, threatening American consumer prices.

## Israel-Palestine

- Shapiro argues Israel's fundamental mistake was decades of complacency — believing Iron Dome and economic integration could substitute for security, which produced the conditions for October 7.
- October 7 attacked disarmed peace villages, not West Bank settlements — many victims were left-wing Israelis who actively worked to improve conditions for Gazans, which Shapiro identifies as the ground-shifting moment for Israeli politics.
- Shapiro's tactical critique of Israel's own war conduct: Defense Minister Yoav Galant recommended striking Hezbollah first given it is a far greater existential threat than Hamas; Netanyahu's war cabinet chose Gaza instead.
- Israel's ground campaign minimizes civilian casualties at the cost of soldiers — Shapiro knows three people killed in Gaza through one degree of separation — producing Israel's highest military death toll since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
- Destiny's critique of Israel: settlement expansion in Area C is provocative and benefits Israel as long as the conflict continues; Israel gets justifications for Golan Heights annexation, West Bank expansion, and Gaza embargoes.
- Both agree the Abraham Accords (UAE, Bahrain, Morocco) were meaningful as first steps toward economic normalization, but Destiny argues the Gulf states were already de facto trading partners with Israel and the accords did not address Palestinians.
- Shapiro identifies the Palestinian Authority's "Martyr Fund" — which pays families of terrorists who kill Jews — as evidence that even the "moderate" West Bank leadership under Abbas is not a viable peace partner.
- Destiny notes West Bank polling shows ~75-80% of Palestinians supported the October 7 attacks, and argues Abbas avoids elections specifically because the Palestinian population wants continued armed conflict.

## Russia-Ukraine

- Shapiro argues the US primary interest in Ukraine was achieved in the first months of the war: preventing Russia from absorbing Ukraine and degrading Russia's military capability sufficiently to prevent threats to Baltic states.
- A negotiated peace deal involving ceding Luhansk, Donetsk, and Crimea to Russia in exchange for Western security guarantees for Ukraine was reportedly on the table early in the war and Putin was willing to sign — Shapiro argues Biden should have forced that deal on Zelenskyy.
- Shapiro's critique: Biden outsourced the end-goal of the war to Zelenskyy ("we'll support you as long as it takes, whatever Zelenskyy says") without defining American interests — a policy that's a recipe for frozen conflict and endless funding.
- Destiny agrees with Shapiro that open-ended missions with unlimited budgets and no clear goals are the worst possible foreign policy, citing Iraq and Afghanistan as proof the US has consistently failed at this.
- Destiny credits Biden for being explicit from the start about what the US would not do: no-fly zones, no US ground troops, no direct US-Russia military confrontation — providing strategic clarity that prevented escalation.
- Both agree the $105 billion package ($60B Ukraine, $14B Israel, Taiwan aid, border provisions) being held up by congressional gridlock represents political dysfunction — Shapiro argues it was political malpractice for Biden not to cave on border provisions to secure the aid.

## January 6 and Democratic Guardrails

- Both agree Trump almost certainly knew he had lost the 2020 election — Destiny argues this directly, Shapiro says he "should have known the day of the election" but disputes that this proves criminal intent under the relevant statutes.
- Shapiro's legal position: Jack Smith did not charge seditious conspiracy or insurrection because he cannot establish the intent necessary to convict under those standards — Smith charged fraud statutes that are themselves a stretch.
- Destiny argues the Eastman theory (that Pence could unilaterally reject electoral votes) was a shitty legal theory designed to prevent a peaceful transfer of power, which Shapiro concedes is "shitty" but not clearly illegal.
- Shapiro's systemic argument: the January 6 guardrails held — Pence refused, Raffensperger refused, Rosen and Donahue refused, Barr refused, the courts refused — and those same guardrails would hold again in a second Trump term.
- Destiny's counter: Trump failed because people around him said no, but a second term Trump who has learned this lesson would appoint loyalists like Giuliani as AG who would not refuse — Shapiro says Senate confirmation would prevent this.
- In 2022, every Secretary of State candidate who ran on the "deny elections" platform lost their race, which Shapiro cites as evidence the American public has a strong anti-authoritarian corrective mechanism.
- Destiny puts 100% probability on Trump trying to prevent a peaceful transfer of power in a second term but expresses uncertainty about whether he would succeed; Shapiro puts 0% probability on a third-term scenario given Trump would not be on the ballot in 2028.

## Wokeism and Institutional Capture

- Shapiro defines wokeism precisely: rooted in postmodernism's claim that all principles reflect power structures, transmitted through neo-Marxist racial theory (Stefancic and Delgado's Critical Race Theory), and institutionalized as DEI — specifically the "E" for equity, not equality.
- Equity means any inequality that emerges from any system is evidence of discrimination; the only corrective is Ibram X. Kendi's "anti-racism" — racism in the service of destroying racism.
- Shapiro identifies this as dangerous because it relieves individuals of personal responsibility, destroys objective meritocracy metrics, and imposes a victim-victimizer narrative that is unhealthy for both individuals and societies.
- Shapiro on Claudine Gay: she deserved to be removed for her congressional hearing performance, not the plagiarism — but firing her accomplishes little because the underlying DEI administrative apparatus that perpetuates the system remains and costs universities billions annually.
- Destiny agrees wokeism started with legitimate goals (representation, civil rights) and achieved real goods, but gets "academia-ized" into Frankenstein outcomes — when someone uses the word "anti-racism" or "colonial" he tunes out.
- Destiny blames conservative abandonment of academia since the late 1960s for the left-capture of institutions — Rush Limbaugh's decades of demonizing colleges drove conservatives away, leaving administrators to drift further left unchallenged.
- Shapiro traces the institutional collapse to 1960s universities where administrators couldn't say "no" to radical demands — citing Shelby Steele's account of a liberal university president who wilted in the face of confrontation.
- Shapiro argues STEM at American universities remains world-class and should be evaluated separately from liberal arts, where self-perpetuating dissertation culture enforces ideological conformity.
- Shapiro's most provocative claim: the non-STEM university is a complete scam — an expensive IQ sorting mechanism that adds no value to what a high school graduate with a good SAT score could do with a direct apprenticeship.

## Monogamy, Marriage, and Social Fabric

- Shapiro describes monogamous marriage as the single most important thing an individual can do for society — it transmits culture and values, gives children a father and mother, and provides the corrective to both communitarian and atomistic individualist excesses.
- Shapiro's claim: the idea that sex carries no emotional component is "completely specious" — commitment to one partner for child-rearing is the evolutionary and civilizational foundation, not a social construct.
- Destiny agrees that introducing children changes the calculus entirely — child-rearing requires the kind of buy-in and structure that open relationships are less equipped to provide — but is agnostic about the moral imperative to have children in the first place.
- Both observe that every industrialized country shows declining birth rates as it becomes wealthier, with no clear policy answer beyond the cultural or religious communities that actively valorize large families.
- Rapid-fire: Shapiro says body count matters; Destiny says it depends on the person. Shapiro would ban pornography as destructive to the human soul with no redeeming benefit; Destiny says no. Shapiro finds OnlyFans destructive even for high earners; Destiny sees it as mixed. Shapiro remains skeptical that rap qualifies as music under his definition (rhythm + melody + harmony) but allows he could be convinced.

## Epistemics and Mutual Respect

- Destiny's test for intellectual honesty: can you argue both sides of a debate convincingly? If not, you are too partisan to engage productively. He also asks himself what evidence would change his mind — if he can't answer, his position is too fixed.
- Shapiro's method: read the New York Times and Breitbart, identify the overlapping factual core, treat the intersection as established fact and everything else as opinion extrapolated from different premises.
- Destiny's compliment to Shapiro: he is more willing to criticize his own party than most conservatives, and he engages on factual grounds rather than retreating to pure philosophy or idealism.
- Shapiro's compliment to Destiny: watching him reason in real time on stream is a rare and genuinely educational window into how a person learns and updates — a gift to his audience that most commentators cannot offer.
- Both agree that political polarization is worsened by algorithmic sorting on social media and ideologically segregated institutions; face-to-face cross-partisan contact — even at bars after debates — reliably humanizes the other side.
- Lex closes with Aristotle: "The basis of a democratic state is liberty."

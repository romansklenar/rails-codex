# Tal Wilkenfeld: Music, Guitar, Bass, Jeff Beck, Prince, and Leonard Cohen | Lex Fridman Podcast #408

A working virtuoso who has played alongside some of the greatest musicians alive reflects on how fear, trust, grief, and meditation shape both artistry and personhood.

## The Jeff Beck Crossroads Solo

- At the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival — Eric Clapton's festival with 400 guitarists — Jeff Beck gave his bass player the solo on "Cause We've Ended as Lovers" rather than playing it himself.
- Tal arrived at Beck's audition straight from a hospital after food poisoning on the plane; Beck answered the door and immediately asked if she was ready to play.
- Beck said "solo" on that song during the audition, loved the result, and kept the bass solo in the set — there had been no bass solo in his arrangements before.
- Beck's decision to bow onstage during Tal's solo at Crossroads was unrehearsed and reflected his generosity as a musician.
- Tal describes Beck as a musician who was "not there for himself — he's there for the music."

## Fear, Trust, and the Edge of the Cliff

- Fear on stage walls a musician off from other players; it forces a perfectionist mindset that makes music less expansive, vulnerable, and true.
- Tal distinguishes "confidence" from "trust": confidence carries ego — a belief that "I am this thing" — whereas trust is the open knowledge that you can handle whatever comes.
- Excessive confidence can function like a brick wall between musicians, just as fear does.
- Standing at the edge of the cliff means staying in the unknown; all possibilities exist there, and pulling back to safety is always an option.
- Beethoven's maxim — "to play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable" — is cited approvingly.
- At Montreux Jazz Festival (the best speaker system she had ever played through), a single note she disliked sent her offstage in tears; Claude Nobs, the festival founder, cheered her up with caviar — literally, not as a joke.
- Recovery speed after a mistake improves with experience until the audience cannot detect the recovery at all.

## Meditation and Pre-Show Ritual

- Tal meditates daily; on her own tours she asks the entire band to meditate together for at least 20 minutes before going on stage — each person uses whatever practice suits them, phones down.
- On tours without private hotel rooms (only one hotel per week), she joined a 12-hour-a-day silent online meditation retreat via Zoom from the back lounge of a moving tour bus.
- The pre-show group meditation produces a noticeably more connected performance; shows where it was skipped felt markedly different.
- She has stayed at both Zen monasteries (waking at 5 a.m. to sit all day) and Vedanta monasteries (meditating on Upanishad texts rather than silent sitting).
- Vedanta provides intellectual answers whenever the mind loops; Zen provides disciplined uncertainty and bodily purging without explanations — she needs both.
- She integrates spiral dynamics / Ken Wilber's Integral Theory ("transcend and include") into her Zen practice through a teacher who combines the two frameworks.

## Grief and the Comedy Store

- Prince died in mid-2016 and Leonard Cohen died in November 2016; the double loss within six months "tore her to shreds" and left her not wanting to play a note of music.
- She put all her belongings in storage, rented out her gear in exchange for a room, and spent months at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles — her first exposure to standup comedy.
- The comedians took her in as family within a day; the experience taught her to "laugh at absolutely anything."
- In 2017 the losses continued: Gregg Allman, Tom Petty — all people she had personally worked with.
- When Jeff Beck died she had Incubus tour dates in two days; Mike Dirnt (Green Day) arrived at her door with a truckload of vintage P-basses and jazz basses to help her find one that felt right.
- She chose an Olympic White jazz bass — the same color as Beck's — began crying, named it "Jeff," and played it on the Incubus tour.
- Grief after Beck's death was easier because the 2016–17 period had given her tools; she knew the process and could go through it again.

## Leonard Cohen

- Tal and Cohen first met at a rehearsal studio; she watched the full rehearsal sitting next to Roshi, Cohen's 105-year-old Zen monk, who tested her presence with a handshake question: "Where are you?" — she answered "In the handshake" and passed.
- Cohen reached out to her after she posted a YouTube performance of "Chelsea Hotel #2"; she had lived at the actual Chelsea Hotel before it was renovated.
- Cohen's songwriting advice: read a draft in the morning, take a walk, read it again, have a fight with your daughter, read it again, wait a week, read it again — the wider the lens across states of mind, the wider the song can land for listeners.
- Cohen's regret about "Chelsea Hotel #2" was not the explicit line ("giving me head on the unmade bed") but the later indiscretion of confirming it was about Janis Joplin; he never removed the line even in retrospect.
- Cohen wrote approximately 80 verses for "Hallelujah" over 15–20 years before arriving at four; Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell by contrast write fast.
- Cohen performed rewritten lyrics of his own songs live not because the originals were bad but to treat words the way a musician treats improvised solos — as living, mutable material.

## Songwriting Philosophy

- Tal identifies first as a songwriter, not as a bassist; the bass-player reputation is a misread of her work.
- Her preference is for love songs that are ambiguous about the object of love — romantic, divine, or universal — citing George Harrison's "What Is Life" and his cover of Dylan's "If Not for You."
- She serves the song: sometimes she uses direct autobiography, sometimes she merges personal experience with a film's narrative (e.g., Taxi Driver as source material for a love song).
- Lyric now matters more to her than music: "there's so much music in the world — if I'm going to write a song, I want it to be about something interesting."
- Writing lyric, melody, chords, and arrangement simultaneously on the first draft is the most generative approach; editing comes after.
- Songs come to her in silence — in the shower, on walks, doing dishes — which is why she values empty hotel rooms and solitude.

## Learning, Practice, and Mental Rehearsal

- Tal started guitar at 14; her parents limited practice to 30 minutes a day, so she learned to visualize the fretboard and practice entirely in her head — similar to how Coltrane reportedly worked through musical ideas mentally.
- Mental rehearsal isolates musical conception from motor skill: if you can play it in your head, you know you genuinely understand it rather than relying on muscle memory alone.
- She practiced in bursts during those 30 minutes — play for two minutes, stop for one, repeat — and noticed faster improvement than continuous repetition.
- Andrew Huberman's neuroscience research later confirmed this: during brief rest breaks after practice, the brain replays the sequence 20–30 times faster and in reverse, consolidating the learning.
- She has never practiced more than one hour a day, even now.
- Slowing a passage to the absolute minimum tempo reveals micro-details — exact finger angle, attack force, emotional intention per note — that remain present when speed is restored.
- Music is not a sport; treating it like one produces technically fast players who lose fullness of tone by not sitting with each note.

## Bass Technique and Instrument Philosophy

- Fingerstyle is her primary approach; slap bass has a distinctive sound that suited funk but was "a bit overused" — her mentor Anthony Jackson threatened to leave any gig that asked him to slap.
- She uses a hollow-body Harmony bass (closer to upright in timbre) for jazz-inflected material, including the recorded version of "Under the Sun."
- For electric bass on jazz, she may palm-mute to approximate the shorter decay of an upright.
- Tone can be changed "a million ways" by the direction of a single finger — attack angle, force, and emotional intention all alter the sound.
- A musician's unique voice is defined as much by what they choose not to play as by what they play — the negative space and the positive space are equal halves.
- Every instrument shares the same 12 (or 24, depending on division) notes; the instrument is a physical specificity of a universal expressive act.

## Recording with Prince

- Prince called Tal after seeing her work with Jeff Beck and proposed a trio; his first question was whether she liked Jack DeJohnette's drum rolls — her informed answer convinced him to trust her to audition and choose the drummer herself.
- The resulting album is "Welcome to America"; recording was done to tape with no punch-ins — Prince's explicit philosophy was that imperfections capture a moment in time and every moment in time is unrepeatable.
- On the track "Same Page, Different Book," Prince talked through the form briefly and then counted the band in live without telling Tal she would be soloing between phrases — forcing improvisational edge.
- Take one typically contained the most gold; after a run of takes people start thinking too much, and the best solution is a dinner break after which take one post-break becomes the keeper.
- Prince avoided playing demos for session musicians: hearing a finished demo predetermines what each player imagines their part should be, undermining fresh contribution.

## Mentorship

- Good mentors provide open space, availability, love, and acceptance — not prescription or harsh criticism.
- Tal's primary mentors were Anthony Jackson (first bass mentor; taught by sitting in cars for hours listening to and discussing music across all genres), Jeff Beck, Leonard Cohen, and Wayne Shorter.
- Steve Gadd's line — "on your worst day, you're still a bad motherfucker" — was passed from Gadd to Anthony Jackson to Tal; all three musicians struggled with perfectionism.
- Harsh critics are unnecessary for serious artists because the inner critic is already present on overdrive; what's needed is an external, non-obligated voice that says "I dig what you're doing — keep going."
- In-person time with a master transmits something non-intellectual and non-verbal that YouTube cannot replicate; she has experienced this directly.

## Impermanence, Grief, and Living Fully

- The distinction between "giving a piece of yourself" to someone and "opening yourself" to them determines whether loss leaves you feeling diminished: opening is not a losing act.
- Loneliness is a product of feeling separate; the experience of separation decreases through meditation and study of scripture.
- Impermanence is the only constant except consciousness itself; the time limit on a human body is not a tragedy but an enticement.
- Since her early 20s Tal has been at peace with the possibility of dying that day, having put full effort and passion into everything already done.
- Her advice to young people: tackle demons early — through art, meditation, journaling, or anything that moves toward rather than away from what is frightening — because avoided demons expand.
- Songs she wrote five years ago now mean new things when she sings them live; lyrics land differently from the vantage point of new experience.

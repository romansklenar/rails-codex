# Janna Levin: Black Holes, Wormholes, Aliens, Paradoxes & Extra Dimensions | Lex Fridman Podcast #468

## Black Holes as Regions of Spacetime

- Karl Schwarzschild solved Einstein's equations from the Eastern Front during World War I in 1915–1916, finding the first exact solution to general relativity while sitting in the trenches between cannon fire.
- Schwarzschild's solution was a thought experiment: he imagined all the mass of a star crushed to a point, without explaining how, and asked what spacetime would look like in that scenario.
- The event horizon — not the singularity — is the black hole; it is an empty region of spacetime marking a causal boundary where inside events cannot affect outside events, but outside events can affect inside.
- At the event horizon there is literally nothing there: no wall, no sign, no marker — a falling astronaut would not even realize they had crossed it, especially for very large black holes where spacetime curvature is gentle.
- A black hole is described completely by only three properties: electric charge, mass, and spin — making it more analogous to a fundamental particle like an electron than to a macroscopic object.
- If you put a mountain like Everest on a black hole it would radiate away the imperfection in gravitational waves and settle back to a perfectly featureless, spinning black hole.
- John Wheeler coined the term "black hole" in 1967 when someone shouted it from the back row of a lecture above Tom's Restaurant (the Seinfeld diner) near Columbia University in New York.

## Formation of Black Holes

- Stars 20–30 times the mass of the sun eventually exhaust their thermonuclear fuel and hit an iron core; fusing past iron is energetically expensive, so the star collapses under its own weight, creating a supernova shockwave.
- If the remaining stellar core is heavier than roughly twice the mass of the sun, it will collapse to a black hole rather than stopping at a neutron star.
- Oppenheimer published his paper predicting black holes as the end state of gravitational collapse on the same day in 1939 that Nazi Germany advanced on Poland, so it received almost no public attention.
- When a collapsing star reaches approximately 60 kilometers across while containing 10 times the sun's mass, the event horizon forms; the star then continues to fall through its own event horizon and disappears from external view.
- John Wheeler initially spent decades arguing Oppenheimer was wrong, but his own computer simulations eventually forced him to conclude Oppenheimer had been right all along.
- Supermassive black holes — billions to hundreds of billions of solar masses — likely did not form by successive mergers of smaller black holes because the universe has not had enough time; they probably formed directly from primordial collapse a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.
- There could be hundreds of millions to perhaps a billion stellar-mass black holes in the Milky Way alone, since roughly 1% of stars end their lives as black holes.

## Inside the Black Hole: Spacetime and Singularities

- Inside a black hole, space and time swap roles: the singularity is not a location in space but a moment in time — the falling astronaut cannot orbit around it or rocket away from it any more than they can avoid the future.
- For a stellar-mass black hole, the time from crossing the event horizon to reaching the singularity is roughly microseconds; for a supermassive black hole, an infalling observer could survive for months.
- From outside, an infalling astronaut appears to slow down and freeze at the event horizon due to extreme time dilation — generations could live and die on an orbiting space station while watching the astronaut never quite fall in.
- From the astronaut's perspective, crossing the event horizon takes no noticeable time and feels unremarkable — their clocks, plants, and biology show no dramatic change at that boundary.
- Inside a black hole it is not necessarily dark: light from the entire galaxy floods in behind the falling observer, focusing toward the singularity and producing a bright white flash — Levin calls it "like a near-death experience, but definitely a total death experience."
- The larger the black hole, the less pronounced the curvature at the event horizon; the experience of crossing it is less noticeable, analogous to standing on the Earth versus standing on a basketball.

## Gravity and General Relativity

- Einstein arrived at general relativity by holding the constancy of the speed of light as an absolute, then deducing that space and time themselves must deform to preserve it — trading absolute space and time for an absolute speed limit.
- The equivalence principle — Einstein called it "the happiest thought of his life" — states that free fall is the purest experience of gravity; weightlessness, not heaviness, is what gravity fundamentally feels like without atoms in the way.
- The International Space Station travels at roughly 17,500 miles per hour and is simply falling continuously along the curve inscribed in spacetime by Earth's mass; the engines are off during orbit.
- In Einsteinian gravity there is no action at a distance: the earth curves spacetime, and the apple follows that curve; the tree is the problem — it accelerates the apple away from its natural free-fall path.
- Schwarzschild's solution is not just about extreme objects: the same formula accurately describes Earth's orbit around the sun, though Newtonian gravity is already a good enough approximation at that scale.
- Einstein did not accept the expanding universe implied by his own equations; it was not until Hubble confirmed other galaxies exist in the late 1920s that the observational basis for cosmic expansion became clear.

## The Information Paradox and Hawking Radiation

- Hawking showed that adding only a small amount of quantum mechanics to the event horizon environment — allowing the quantum vacuum to have virtual particle pairs straddle the horizon — causes black holes to slowly evaporate and radiate thermally.
- Hawking radiation is featureless and thermal: it contains no information about what fell into the black hole, only about the hole's mass, which was already knowable from outside.
- As a black hole evaporates it gets hotter, not cooler — a shrinking black hole radiates more intensely, eventually exploding away entirely after a time much longer than the current age of the universe.
- The information paradox: quantum mechanics forbids the destruction of quantum information (unitarity), yet Hawking radiation appears to erase all information about infalling matter — placing general relativity and quantum mechanics in direct conflict.
- Lenny Susskind titled his book on this debate "The Black Hole Wars: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics."
- Janna Levin's position is that unitarity will be preserved — quantum mechanics will win — and that information is not truly destroyed, even if the mechanism by which it escapes is not yet fully understood.

## Proposed Resolutions: Fuzzballs, Soft Hair, ER = EPR, Firewalls

- The fuzz ball proposal from string theory holds that black holes have no interior at all: strings smear around the event horizon due to time dilation, tangling into a horizonless object, so information never falls in and therefore never needs to come back out.
- The soft hair proposal, developed by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger, challenges the classical no-hair theorem by suggesting that very low-energy quantum excitations — soft gravitons or photons — at the event horizon can encode information about infalling matter.
- ER = EPR, conjectured by Juan Maldacena and Lenny Susskind, posits that quantum entanglement (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) and wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) are the same phenomenon — entangled particles are literally connected by a microscopic wormhole.
- In the ER = EPR picture, the event horizon of a black hole is not a smooth geometric surface but is "embroidered" from a dense fabric of quantum wormholes linking the interior to the Hawking radiation escaping outside.
- Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence — the most highly cited paper in the history of physics, published in the late 1990s — showed that a universe in a box with gravity is exactly equivalent to a boundary theory with no gravity and no information loss, strongly suggesting quantum mechanics must win.
- The AMPS firewall (Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, Sully) argued that preserving unitarity forces the event horizon to be a wall of extremely high-energy radiation that incinerates anything crossing it — violating the equivalence principle; Levin thinks firewalls are not real but that the papers were crucial for exposing flaws in prior complementarity arguments and reinvigorating the search for a solution.

## Wormholes and Extra Dimensions

- Wormholes are valid solutions to Einstein's equations — topological handles connecting distant regions of spacetime — but reverse-engineering the matter needed to build one reveals it must have negative energy, a property not seen in ordinary matter.
- The Casimir effect — a quantum phenomenon where two nearby metal plates attract due to vacuum fluctuations — demonstrates that negative energy densities are physically real, suggesting wormhole-stabilizing exotic matter is not categorically impossible.
- Kip Thorne, who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for LIGO, worked seriously on traversable wormhole designs, concluding that while the physics is not ruled out, the engineering requirements are far beyond anything currently conceivable.
- String theory requires extra spatial dimensions to be mathematically consistent; even without string theory, extra compact dimensions could trap quantum energies that might explain dark matter or dark energy.
- One model for extra dimensions pictures a universe in which three spatial dimensions expanded from the Big Bang while others remained tightly curled — with ongoing work trying to explain why exactly three unraveled and not four or two.
- An alternative model places us on a three-dimensional membrane (brane) moving through a higher-dimensional bulk; the extra dimensions could be large, not tiny, but we are confined to the brane and cannot directly detect them.
- Gravity can propagate through the bulk between branes, so hypothetical civilizations on parallel branes could in principle communicate using gravitational waves — though generating and localizing them would require enormous energy.

## Aliens, Life, and the Fermi Paradox

- The number of exoplanets in the Milky Way likely exceeds the number of stars — around 300 billion stars — making it nearly impossible to argue that life never arose elsewhere in our galaxy.
- Levin believes the greatest evolutionary bottleneck may be multicellularity, not the origin of single-celled life: life on Earth appeared quickly after the planet formed, but took billions of years to become multicellular.
- Humans have been around for roughly 200,000 years and already possess the means of their own extinction, making us a statistically alarming example of how rapidly intelligence can become existentially dangerous.
- Dinosaurs survived for 250 million years without inventing a means of self-destruction, illustrating that intelligence coupled with tool-use is a uniquely dangerous combination.
- Levin argues that our bias toward imagining humanoid, technology-using aliens is a failure of imagination: some jellyfish show evidence of biological immortality by reverting to an earlier developmental state when severely damaged, and they have survived for vast stretches of time with no localized brain.
- Life at its most general may be defined by organized information processing that creates local pockets of low entropy, which could take arbitrarily different chemical and physical forms — including organisms that metabolize minerals rather than organic compounds.
- A possible physics-based explanation for why alien signals are absent: if civilizations exist on other branes, they would be invisible to us, detectable only indirectly through gravitational leakage through the bulk.

## Gravitational Waves and LIGO

- Gravitational waves are ripples in the shape of spacetime itself, not electromagnetic radiation — they are invisible to all telescopes and completely dark, yet they carry energy encoded as E = mc².
- Two merging black holes lose mass in the final black hole relative to the sum of the two progenitors; that missing mass is radiated away entirely as gravitational waves.
- The frequency of gravitational waves from merging stellar-mass black holes falls within the human auditory range; near enough to a merger, the waves would physically squeeze and stretch eardrums in vacuum, making them literally audible.
- LIGO's 4-kilometer L-shaped tunnels contain the largest sustained vacuum volumes in Earth's atmosphere; the instrument measures spacetime distortions smaller than one ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton across 4 kilometers.
- The first gravitational wave detection, on September 14, 2015, was recorded by the Louisiana detector first, then Washington state, and was caused by a merger that occurred roughly 1.3 billion years ago — when multicellular life was only beginning on Earth.
- The signal arrived during an engineering calibration run, minutes after technicians had gone home for the night; the machine had been left locked, and the wave was captured essentially by accident.
- The 2015 detection was the centenary year of Einstein publishing general relativity: the gravitational wave that triggered LIGO was already traveling through space when Einstein wrote down the theory that predicted it.
- Ray Weiss, who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize with Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, told Levin a month before the detection that if no black holes were found, "this whole thing's a failure and we've led this country down the wrong path."

## Godel, Turing, and the Limits of Knowledge

- Godel proved incompleteness: there exist mathematical facts about the natural numbers that are true but can never be proven within any consistent formal system — equivalent to saying there is no theory of everything for mathematics.
- Turing's work on uncomputable numbers grew directly from engagement with Godel's incompleteness results, and led him to imagine a universal machine that could execute any computable task by loading different software — the conceptual blueprint for the modern computer.
- Turing used early versions of his computational thinking to break the German Enigma code during World War II; historians believe his small group's work materially turned the tide of the war in the Allies' favor.
- Godel walked with Einstein to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton every day and proved a rotating-universe solution to Einstein's equations in which closed time-like curves allow backward time travel — a mathematically valid result that deeply unsettled Einstein.
- Godel was likely a paranoid schizophrenic; fearing his food was poisoned, he refused to eat and literally starved himself to death.
- Turing was prosecuted in Britain for homosexuality in the early 1950s and sentenced to chemical castration; he died from cyanide poisoning, widely believed to be suicide — possibly by biting a cyanide-laced apple in a deliberate reference to Snow White.
- The Apple logo featuring a bite taken from an apple is widely believed to be a tribute to Turing, though Apple has officially neither confirmed nor denied it.
- Andrew Wiles spent approximately seven years in isolation to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, announced a proof, had an error found during peer review, and then spent an additional year fixing it — a level of tenacity Levin considers almost incomprehensible.
- Grigori Perelman proved the Poincare Conjecture, spent years doing so largely alone, and then declined both the Fields Medal and the $1 million Millennium Prize before retreating to live in St. Petersburg, Russia.

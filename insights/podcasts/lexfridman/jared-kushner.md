# Jared Kushner: Israel, Palestine, Hamas, Gaza, Iran, and the Middle East | Lex Fridman Podcast #399

Recorded in two parts — October 5 and October 9, 2023 — this conversation captures Kushner's immediate reaction to the Hamas attack alongside a pre-recorded deep-dive into the diplomatic machinery behind the Abraham Accords, USMCA, US-China tariff negotiations, and criminal justice reform.

## October 7 Attack and Immediate Context

- The first part of the podcast was recorded October 5; after the Hamas attack on October 7 Kushner returned on October 9 to address the crisis directly.
- On October 7 at 6:30 AM Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of rockets and sent over 1,000 militants door-to-door through border towns; by October 9 the death toll exceeded 1,200 with over 130 hostages taken to Gaza.
- Kushner describes the attack as the largest terror event since 9/11 and draws comparisons to images of militants at a rave shooting civilians and Holocaust survivors being taken captive.
- Hamas has governed Gaza for 16 years and has nothing to show for it; Kushner's frame is that the 2.3 million people of Gaza are hostages of 30,000 Hamas terrorists.
- He credits Iran as the primary backer: under Trump, Iran's oil exports were cut from approximately 2.6 million to 100,000 barrels per day; under Biden enforcement lapsed and revenues rose to an estimated $45 billion annually.
- The attack's name, Al-Aqsa Flood, instrumentalizes the mosque as propaganda — a tactic Kushner traces to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who used the same narrative to fundraise from Indonesia and Pakistan in the 1920s while working with Hitler and Mussolini.

## Iran's Role and Proxy Strategy

- Iran fights through proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis — rather than direct military engagement; the Hamas attack fits this pattern.
- The Saudi-Iran detente around 2023 led to a reduction in Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia, which Kushner says proves Iran was behind the Houthis all along.
- Under Trump, crushing sanctions depleted Iran's foreign currency reserves; the Biden administration eased enforcement to lower global oil prices and gave Iran approximately $6 billion in exchange for hostages shortly before the attack.
- Kushner argues Iran's motive for the October 7 attack was specifically to derail the Israeli-Saudi normalization deal that was advancing in 2023.

## The Peace to Prosperity Plan and Gaza Economics

- Kushner led a 181-page economic plan called "Peace to Prosperity" covering Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, and Egypt, modeled partly on Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.
- He studied post-WWII economic success stories — South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Poland — and found Ukraine's failure instructive because of governance and corruption problems analogous to Palestinian governance.
- The plan estimated Gaza could be rebuilt for $7–8 billion, poverty could be halved, and over one million jobs created; the Bahrain conference with Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone and AT&T's CEO confirmed feasibility.
- The constraint was not Israel but Hamas governance: construction materials sent into Gaza were used to build tunnels, pipes were converted into rockets.
- Palestinian Authority leadership was in the 16th year of a four-year term, and Kushner observed that every time peace talks failed, Palestinian leaders received more international aid, removing their incentive to conclude a deal.
- Palestinian Authority under Abbas flew on a $60 million Boeing BBJ to meetings while Netanyahu flew commercial El Al.

## Abraham Accords — Mechanics and Sequencing

- The Trump administration's core Middle East strategy: recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, move the embassy, recognize the Golan Heights, exit the Iran deal, hold an economic conference in Bahrain — each step was declared catastrophic in advance, and each time the sun rose the next morning.
- The Abraham Accords produced six normalization agreements: UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, Kosovo, Morocco, plus a GCC reconciliation between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain.
- The first step was a three-way phone call between Trump, Netanyahu, and Mohammed bin Zayed; the breakthrough moment was the first commercial El Al flight from Israel to UAE, filled with health, financial, and legal delegations.
- The picture of Kushner's team disembarking an El Al plane bearing an Israeli flag and being greeted by Emiratis in thobes captured global attention despite being an improvised add-on to the trip.
- Kushner separates two conflated issues: the Israeli-Muslim world dispute (centered on Al-Aqsa access) and the Israeli-Palestinian territorial dispute; resolving them separately unlocked the Arab normalization track.
- Sultan Qaboos of Oman told Kushner, "I feel badly for the Palestinian people that they carry with them the burden of the Muslim world" — this observation reframed the entire negotiating structure for Kushner.

## Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin Salman

- Kushner's initial brief on Saudi Arabia was generic talking points (women's rights, Wahhabism export, fair share); Saudi minister Fahad Toonsi told him, "You don't know much about Saudi Arabia, do you?" and proposed a comprehensive reform offer.
- King Salman, on a call with Trump, directed that MBS (then Deputy Crown Prince) should deal with Kushner; the State Department and NSC had been lobbying for MBN, who ran intelligence.
- MBS's governing philosophy on goals: "If I set five goals and achieve five, I accomplish five things. If I set 100 goals and fail at 50, I accomplish 50 things."
- Vision 2030 includes publicly stated KPIs for the Saudi economy — Kushner found the concept of a government setting measurable national KPIs unusual and admirable.
- On Jamal Khashoggi: MBS told Kushner the same thing he said publicly on 60 Minutes — accepting responsibility as leader and committing to reforms to prevent recurrence.
- Kushner's broader point: one tragedy should not cancel the structural logic of an entire strategic relationship, just as accountability must coexist with the prevention of worse outcomes.

## Negotiation Philosophy

- First principle: trust is table stakes — people must believe you won't use what they share against them.
- He reframes every negotiation: instead of "me vs. you," the question is "we're both on the same side of the table — what outcome are we trying to reach together?"
- Kushner maps escape routes — reasons a politician could claim talks cannot proceed — then eliminates or blocks them, and builds a "golden bridge" that makes the desired outcome the most rational self-interested path.
- On reading The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman: WWI killed 16 million people via treaty entanglements no one actually intended to trigger; the lesson was to always pick up the phone and try before institutional inertia takes over.
- The North Korea back channel started with a call from an old business contact who had done business in North Korea; with CIA involvement, it opened the back channel that led to the Trump-Kim Jong-un meeting.
- Lesson from Thirteen Days in September by Lawrence Wright: Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Israel's Knesset was triggered in part by a miscommunication between a mystic advisor and Begin — symbolism can create political possibility faster than substance.
- Words without credible actions are weak; Trump's unpredictability made American words disproportionately effective because everyone knew he was willing to act.

## Government Bureaucracy and Business Mindset

- Kushner found government full of capable, committed people waiting for direction and cover — the deficit was project management skill, not personnel.
- He supervised construction of approximately 470 miles of border barrier in about two years by applying private-sector project management to Customs, Border Patrol, Army Corps of Engineers, and DHS.
- Regulation critique from Niall Ferguson's The Great Degeneration: regulations solve past crises, not future ones; in the last year of Obama, the private sector spent 6 million man-hours complying with new federal regulations.
- Under Trump, for every new regulation added, two were eliminated; in year one, the ratio was eight eliminated per one added.
- In the private sector, working on a problem for ten weeks without results means unemployment; in government, working on a problem for ten years and failing earns the label of expert.
- Incentive structure distortion: people in politics avoid hard problems because failure is more costly than in business and success threatens the incumbent expert class.

## Russia Collusion Investigation

- After the 2016 election, media institutions shifted from acknowledging a failed prediction to attributing Trump's victory to Russian collusion — a narrative Kushner knew was false from inside the campaign, where he ran finance, digital media, and scheduling.
- He spent over 20 hours testifying before House, Senate, and special counsel investigations and paid millions out of pocket in legal fees; his strategy was to cooperate fully, knowing a good fact pattern required good lawyering but not miracles.
- The experience taught Kushner to focus only on what he could control: he framed his White House time as sand through an hourglass and refused to let the investigation consume his working hours.
- He observed how CNN panels could discuss his committing "treason" over a meeting where he asked an ambassador for a perspective on Syria policy.

## His Father's Imprisonment and Personal Formation

- His father Charles Kushner was prosecuted after siblings turned over company documents to the US attorney; the case converted a civil dispute into a criminal one. His father accepted responsibility, served a year in federal prison in Alabama, and did not blame others publicly.
- Jared was in NYU law and business school simultaneously and considering a career in public service when the arrest happened; he effectively dropped regular attendance, ran the family company, and still earned his degrees.
- His father's post-arrest words: "In life, sometimes we get so powerful that we believe we are the dealer. But we're not the dealer. God is the dealer." Kushner interpreted this as a lesson about disconnection from grounding and values.
- The experience introduced Kushner to prison life directly; he spent weekends visiting Alabama and began advising other families navigating similar situations.
- His father subsequently hired people from Rikers Island through a second-chance employment program.
- The quote Kushner uses on money and power comes from Death Row Records co-founder Michael Harris: "Money just makes you more of what you already are."

## US-China Trade and the 100-Year Marathon Thesis

- The first Trump-Xi call was negotiated by agreeing in advance that Trump would acknowledge the One China Policy; Xi came to Mar-a-Lago, and the planned 15-minute meeting ran an hour and a half.
- Trump agreed not to raise Taiwan for four years; during the Trump administration, Taiwan was effectively a non-issue in bilateral relations.
- The Hundred-Year Marathon by Michael Pillsbury (which Pillsbury speaks fluent Mandarin): China's thesis, in Pillsbury's telling, is a plan from 1949 to 2049 to reclaim global leadership, using the US's own technology transfers, university systems, and capital markets to build Chinese power.
- Trump's tariff strategy went further than advisors predicted was possible: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told Ivanka and Jared each new tariff round would crash the economy; Trump escalated repeatedly.
- When China retaliated surgically targeting politically vulnerable US sectors (farming), Trump took tariff revenue and compensated farmers directly, then doubled the tariffs.
- China achieved 90%+ global market share in solar panel manufacturing through state subsidies; it also controls most rare earth mining and refining needed for solar panels and electric vehicles — Kushner uses this as the model of predatory strategic industrial policy.

## Ukraine and Russia

- Kushner's position: the Ukraine war would not have happened under Trump; under Bush Russia took Georgia, under Obama Russia took Crimea, under Trump there were no territorial advances.
- The Biden administration's errors, in his view: insulting Saudi Arabia, stopping domestic oil production while trying to revive the Iran deal to lower oil prices, and projecting weakness that emboldened Russia.
- For ending the Ukraine war: both leaders need a trusted back channel where they can communicate an off-ramp without it leaking publicly; neither can publicly retreat from the positions they've stated to their populations.
- Putin's historical frame, as Kushner understands it: Russia has been invaded by Poland (1600s), Sweden (1700s), Napoleon (1800s), Germany twice (1900s), and the Mongols before that — NATO expansion westward is read as creeping encirclement.
- The largest oil production cut in history: Kushner negotiated a deal over Passover during COVID between Russia and Saudi Arabia (and eventually Mexico) after demand collapsed and US storage was running out; a three-way call between King Salman, Putin, and Trump to announce it nearly collapsed when King Salman revealed Mexico had not agreed.

## Hope for the Future

- Kushner's optimistic frame: the Middle East that spent 20 years on bullets and bombs now has young leadership in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar focused on economic ambition.
- Israel as disconnected Silicon Valley: strong tech economy, but lacking regional integration; the Abraham Accords began connecting it.
- AI, cheap energy, and medical advances are the civilizational levers Kushner believes could produce a "dawn for humanity" in 10–20 years, including multi-planetary capability.
- His governing lesson from government: a person with no traditional qualifications who approaches hard problems with listening, first principles, and willingness to try can succeed where decades of expert failure accumulated.
- He closes by citing John Stuart Mill's marketplace of ideas: seek out people who disagree, don't call them names, ask why they believe what they believe.

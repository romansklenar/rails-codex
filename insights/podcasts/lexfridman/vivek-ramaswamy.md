# Vivek Ramaswamy: Trump, Conservatism, Nationalism, Immigration, and War | Lex Fridman Podcast #445

A wide-ranging policy conversation in which Ramaswamy frames dismantling the nanny state — entitlement, regulatory, and foreign-policy — as the single organizing mission that conservatism has been missing.

## What Conservatism Actually Stands For

- Ramaswamy argues the Republican Party has become expert at listing what it opposes (wokeism, Biden agenda) but has failed to articulate a positive vision, which he blames for the lack of a red wave in 2022.
- The four core conservative ideals he names are merit, free speech, self-governance, and rule of law — all rooted in the 1776 founding.
- He frames the cultural anchor of conservatism as: individual, family, nation, and God — explicitly ranked above race, gender, sexuality, and climate as identity markers.
- Self-governance is his most urgent priority: the people elected to run the government are no longer the ones running it because unelected bureaucrats hold real power.

## Steel-Manning Progressivism and Its Failure

- He gives progressivism's strongest case as: America's founding ideals were not practiced (slave-owning founders, inequality for women), creating a power structure whose vestiges require active correction.
- His counter: corrective racial equity policies recreate the very divisions they claim to heal, and when you take something from someone based on their genetics you foster animus toward other groups.
- He cites Springfield, Ohio — 20,000 Haitians in a 50,000-person city — as a case where a charitable impulse (TPS after the 2010 Haiti earthquake) produces predictable reactionary backlash.
- Second counter: merit and group quotas are fundamentally incompatible; a meritocracy requires differential outcomes across people with different God-given gifts.

## DEI: Diversity of Demographics, Hostility to Diversity of Thought

- DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) is a corporate and institutional framework requiring representation targets by race, gender, and sexual orientation across hiring and culture.
- Ramaswamy's primary objection is not anti-meritocracy but that DEI creates legal liability for organizations that permit certain viewpoints, effectively suppressing free exchange of ideas.
- He cites an EEOC case: a woman who wore a red sweater on Fridays to honor veterans was told to stop because a minority employee called it a microaggression — an example of DEI eliminating thought diversity in the name of demographic diversity.
- His response to Mark Cuban's pro-DEI argument (diversity finds talent in overlooked places): in a truly free market, companies already have competitive incentive to hire the best regardless of background; you don't need ESG, DEI, or CSR regimes enforced by the government to achieve that.
- Government contractors are required to adopt racial and gender representation targets — that is not the free market working.

## The Bureaucracy as the Real Problem

- Bureaucracies prioritize their own survival above their stated mission; wokeness has been used by bureaucracies to deflect accountability for substantive failures.
- General Mark Milley talking about "white rage" rather than the military's actual failures in Iraq is an example of "blowing woke smoke to deflect accountability."
- Claiming math is racist is easier for an education bureaucracy than accepting accountability for failing to teach inner-city kids math and fixing zip-code-coded school funding traps.
- The administrative state expanded through Woodrow Wilson, metastasized through FDR's New Deal, LBJ's Great Society, and was aided by Nixon and subsequent Republican presidents.
- Founding fathers were inventors and creators — Benjamin Franklin (lightning rod, Franklin stove, musical instruments), Thomas Jefferson (swivel chair, Virginia State Capitol dome) — not bureaucrats; anti-bureaucracy was the essence of the founding.
- The Old World view: people cannot be trusted to self-govern; enlightened technocrats must protect them from themselves. The American founding rejected this view explicitly.

## Government Efficiency and the 75% Cut

- Ramaswamy proposes a 75% headcount reduction in the federal bureaucracy, shutting down agencies that shouldn't exist and rescinding every unconstitutional regulation Congress never passed.
- The two risks: cutting too little (the hydra grows back one head at a time) vs. cutting too much and losing some muscle — he advocates accepting the second risk.
- Thought experiment for a stochastic 75% cut: fire everyone whose Social Security number ends in an odd digit (50%), then fire those whose number starts with an odd digit from the remainder — no discrimination lawsuits, clear decks immediately.
- His empirical rule: 25% of people do 80–90% of the useful work; government agencies are no different from companies in this respect.
- The primary motivation people have for leaving jobs, drawn from his years interviewing every candidate at Roivant: not pay, but feeling they could not achieve the maximum of their potential in that role.
- Regulatory state is described as "a wet blanket on the American economy"; most federal regulations are unconstitutional and only require a president with a spine to rescind them.
- Elon Musk told Ramaswamy his 75% proposal needed the words "at least" in front of it.

## The Department of Education and Proper Scope of Government

- The Department of Education was created to ensure states (particularly in the South) were not siphoning federal dollars from Black school districts to White ones — a problem Ramaswamy says no longer exists in that form.
- Inner-city school districts, many predominantly Black, already spend more per student than other districts yet produce worse outcomes, suggesting funding level is not the binding constraint.
- Today the DoE withholds funding from schools that include subjects like archery in their curriculum — an inversion of its original mandate.
- Proper roles of the federal government: protect national borders and sovereignty; protect private property rights by preventing externalization of costs (e.g., dumping chemicals in a neighbor's river). Together these cover 80–90% of legitimate government purpose.
- His preferred alternative to federal education control: local school districts, vouchers, educational savings accounts, charter schools — democratic choices made at the municipal level.

## Supreme Court and the Legal Landscape for Reform

- West Virginia v. EPA (2022): if Congress has not passed a rule into law and it concerns a "major question," it cannot be implemented by an unelected regulator's pen — renders most federal regulations unconstitutional.
- Loper Bright (2024): overturned 50 years of Chevron Deference, which required federal courts to defer to agencies' own interpretations of their statutory authority.
- SEC v. Jarkesy: SEC internal tribunals — where the agency writes rules, enforces them, and adjudicates punishments — were held unconstitutional under separation of powers.
- These three cases together Ramaswamy calls "seismic" for the regulatory state and a legal backdrop Trump 1.0 did not have available.

## Immigration: Honesty as the Core Reform

- The U.S. immigration system selects for willingness to lie: the primary path to entry is claiming asylum or refugee status, criteria the vast majority of applicants do not actually meet.
- He describes a specific case reported by the New York Times: a Russian woman granted entry on LGBTQ persecution grounds who admitted under pressure she was not gay and was seeking better economic conditions.
- His preferred immigration criteria: language fluency, civic knowledge and allegiance to founding ideals, demonstrable economic contribution — all more stringent than current asylum-based selection.
- A highly accomplished immigrant he knows — Princeton undergrad, Harvard Business School, investment professional, former competitive tennis player and concert pianist, sub-60-second Rubik's cube solver — cannot get a green card after 10 years in the U.S.
- Mass deportation priority order: first, those committing additional crimes while here; second, those already in detention; third, those in Temporary Protected Status past its intended duration.
- He explicitly does not blame individual Haitians in Springfield; blames the federal policy that relocated 20,000 people into a 50,000-person city without an assimilation plan.
- Australia's detention-until-adjudication policy has significantly reduced fraudulent asylum claims compared to the U.S. approach of releasing claimants into the community.
- He rejects both the nativist "blood and soil" view (represented by Ann Coulter) and the purely economic-zone view of America; his position: American identity is creedal, based on allegiance to the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.
- American exceptionalism is impossible on a blood-and-soil basis because Italy and Japan would have stronger claims by that logic given their ethnic homogeneity.

## Donald Trump, 2020, and Election Integrity

- Ramaswamy's steel-man against Trump for independent voters: age and generational distance from younger voters' concerns, a vulnerability the Biden-to-Harris swap made asymmetric.
- He does not accept the claim that Trump is "a threat to democracy" as a serious criticism; he calls it nonsense.
- His account of 2020: government bureaucratic actors in the intelligence community pressured tech companies to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story as "Russian disinformation" — a claim now known to be false.
- Suppressing the laptop story via Twitter (including blocking peer-to-peer DMs), Google, and all major platforms on the eve of the election he calls "the most undemocratic thing that's happened in the history of our country."
- Post-election polling convinced him that if the laptop story had not been suppressed, Trump would unambiguously be president today.
- His proposed solution: single-day voting on a national holiday, paper ballots, government-issued voter ID matched to voter rolls — the same system used in Puerto Rico.
- He draws a hard line between media bias (a problem) and government-directed censorship (a categorically different and more serious violation of democratic norms).

## Ukraine: A Three-Party Deal to Weaken the Russia-China Alliance

- The Russian perspective Ramaswamy acknowledges: James Baker committed to Mikhail Gorbachev in the early 1990s that NATO would not expand "one inch past East Germany"; NATO has since expanded far more than it did during the entire Cold War.
- The Western position: Russia was the aggressor crossing a sovereign border in violation of international norms.
- His proposed deal structure: territorial discussions based on current occupation lines plus hard guarantees against NATO expansion, in exchange for Russia withdrawing from its military alliance with China and its military presence from the Western Hemisphere (Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua).
- Reopening Western economic relations with Russia is the carrot to pull Russia away from China — he compares this to Nixon pulling China away from the USSR in the early 1970s.
- Zelenskyy was ready to negotiate a deal in early-to-mid 2022 until Boris Johnson (facing his own domestic political problems) traveled to Kyiv to persuade him to keep fighting — a decision Ramaswamy argues cost Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives.
- Nations that don't pay for their own security face moral hazard: they take risks they wouldn't take if they bore the full cost.

## China: Decoupling, Red Lines, and Strategic Clarity

- 95% of U.S. ibuprofen supply depends on Chinese supply chains; U.S. military semiconductors also depend on China — Ramaswamy calls this incoherent for a country that claims China as a top adversary.
- Strategy to reduce conflict risk: lower the existential stakes by decoupling critical supply chains; this means expanding trade with Japan, South Korea, India, and the Philippines — which conflicts with the anti-trade-deal wing of the right.
- Strategic ambiguity between adversaries is the mechanism through which world wars historically emerge; he calls for clear red lines on both sides.
- His red line on Taiwan: the U.S. must not tolerate forcible annexation; but he also supports maintaining the One China policy rather than unilaterally recognizing Taiwan as an independent state, which is China's stated red line.
- Weakening the Russia-China alliance via the Ukraine deal simultaneously weakens China's military posture because Russia has hypersonic missile capabilities that exceed China's.
- Under Trump's first term: no major new wars in the Middle East, North Korea tension defused. Under Biden's first four years: Russia-Ukraine war, Gaza conflict. He frames the results as an argument for Trump.

## What He Would Do Differently and the 2028 Question

- Biggest campaign mistake: being in nine states over seven days before the first debate instead of taking structured pauses to reflect and recenter on his core mission.
- His three-word summary of his presidential campaign and worldview: "Shut it down."
- He does not rule out a 2028 run; says the issues that drove him into the race (lost generation, identity vacuum, nanny state) remain unsolved.
- He identifies as a member of the "creator class" — distinct from the managerial class — and says the creator class is more constrained today than at any point when America has been at its best.
- Post-campaign activities: executive producer on "City of Dreams" (a film about human trafficking), started new companies, resumed competitive tennis practice with the Ohio State team.
- Writing process: physical activity (running, tennis, lifting) opens his mind; carries a notebook everywhere; his fourth book in four years, "Truths: The Future of America First," began as personal reflection before morphing into its final form.

## Approach to Debate and Intellectual Honesty

- His first instinct when receiving criticism is always to ask "are they right?" — genuine openness that he says occasionally does change his position.
- He credits Ann Coulter for having the honesty to articulate blood-and-soil nationalism openly rather than leaving it implicit, even while he strongly rejects the view.
- He names John Fetterman as a Democrat he finds intellectually interesting: evidence of actual conviction, willingness to buck his party (e.g., criticizing Harris's unrealized capital gains tax), and a demonstrated capacity for genuine position evolution.
- Curiosity is his stated antidote to outrage in adversarial debates — he is more interested in the psychology motivating a climate protester than in rebutting their specific argument.
- He opposes a right-wing nanny state as much as a left-wing one: against credit card interest rate caps (a price control), against expanding CFPB and FTC remit under conservative watch, against crony capitalism and factory farming exemptions.

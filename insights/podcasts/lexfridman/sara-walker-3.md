# Sara Walker: Physics of Life, Time, Complexity, and Aliens | Lex Fridman Podcast #433

## Defining Life

- Walker rejects the definition "life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution" — she considers every word in it wrong as a descriptor of life.
- No organism is truly self-sustaining: every organism requires an environment, so self-sustaining is already coupled to the world around it — a paradox that makes societies, not individuals, fit the criterion better.
- Defining life as chemical is a mistake — chemistry is merely the first substrate where the combinatorial space of possibilities becomes too large to exhaust; life is not chemical, it emerges in chemistry.
- Darwinian evolution happens at the population level, not the individual level, so a definition requiring Darwinian evolution implies populations are alive but individual organisms are not.
- Carl Sagan's classic essay on definitions noted that cars would qualify as the dominant life form under most textbook definitions, since cars are self-reproducing (in aggregate), mobile, and consume energy — illustrating that all canonical definitions have fatal counterexamples.
- The zombie-ant fungus (Ophiocordyceps) illustrates why individual boundaries are incoherent: the ant is dead but piloted by the fungus; the two together constitute something alive, dissolving the notion of the individual as the unit of life.
- Walker's working definition: life is the process by which information structures matter over time and space, producing an open-ended cascade of increasing structure and complexity — individuals are just short temporal moments within that larger causal structure.
- Vitalists were not entirely wrong: life could be a material property that still possesses many features the vitalists found mysterious, once we expand our concept of what matter is — just as Aristotle's concept of motion was replaced by mass and acceleration, not disproven.
- Walker argues that language, mathematics, and memes may qualify as forms of life — not alive in a biological sense, but instantiating the same open-ended combinatorial property that characterizes life.
- The reason definitions of life break down is not definitional sloppiness but a category error: we try to define an individual as the unit of life when the real unit is an interconnected lineage extending across billions of years.

## Time, Space, and the Size of Living Objects

- Living objects are not big in space — they are big in time; we fail to perceive this because our evolved perception privileges spatial size over temporal depth.
- Walker's key claim: the entire causal history of the universe required to produce you is, in a meaningful sense, you — humans are 4-billion-year-old objects, not 30- or 70-year-old ones.
- The universe is far larger in time than in space; this planet — home to 4 billion years of evolving life — is one of the biggest structures in the known universe, measured in temporal depth rather than physical volume.
- The modern technosphere — the global integration of biological life and technology — is, in Walker's framework, the largest single object in time that we know of.
- Things only look emergent because we cannot see time: if we could perceive the full causal tail of any living object, what appears as sudden emergence would be revealed as a very long scaffold of prior construction.
- Humans can reason abstractly because they are temporally enormous — the depth of causal history in us is what enables deep abstraction; going more abstract means going deeper into that temporal structure.
- Two humans are "close in time" because they share most of their causal history, which is why they can understand each other, communicate effectively, and share some sense of each other's inner experience.
- Schrödinger predicted in *What Is Life?* that living matter likely involves laws of physics hitherto unknown — Walker agrees and argues that non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the main approach since Schrödinger, is not the right framework; entropy is largely irrelevant to what life actually does.

## Assembly Theory

- Assembly theory formalizes the boundary in the space of all possible objects above which objects are too complex to exist without evolutionary history — they require selection, not just chance chemistry.
- The theory defines two measurable observables: copy number (how many copies of an object are observed) and assembly index (the minimum number of recursive steps to construct the object from elementary building blocks such as chemical bonds).
- Lee Cronin's lab experimentally validated that for organic molecules, the threshold assembly index is approximately 15: molecules with an assembly index above 15 are only ever observed in high copy numbers when life produced them.
- Taxol has a molecular weight of approximately 853 daltons; if every three-dimensional conformation of every molecule sharing its molecular formula were instantiated as one molecule, they would fill 1.5 universes in volume — illustrating why chemical space is too vast to exhaust randomly.
- The assembly universe is ordered in time by causal depth (assembly index), and each layer is exponentially larger than the one before — making the "long way around" to any complex object not merely improbable but exponentially receding.
- Autocatalytic sets — the idea that A makes B, B makes C, and C makes A, closing a self-reinforcing loop — have been in the origin-of-life literature since Stuart Kauffman, but assembly theory makes them more rigorous by grounding them in causal histories rather than ad hoc functional assumptions.
- Cronin's non-organic molybdenum ring experiment — a large molybdenum cluster (~150 atoms) that acts as a template for its own synthesis — reveals the mechanism of the origin-of-life transition: combinatorial chemical space collapses onto a tiny self-reinforcing subset.
- Walker now believes the origin of life is abrupt, not gradual — life snaps into existence when the possibility space collapses onto a self-reinforcing structure; this is consistent with the phase-transition structure that assembly theory predicts.
- The most significant struggle for existence is not between objects that do exist but between those that do exist and those that never get the chance to: every time the universe produces a new structure along a causal chain, it excludes an exponentially large space of alternatives that become exponentially less likely ever to exist.
- Deterministic macroscopic structures like living organisms emerge from a random quantum-mechanical background: elementary particles live in a probabilistic space, but objects that have accumulated sufficient causal scaffolding become increasingly deterministic and classical.

## Origin of Life

- The origin-of-life transition occurs at the boundary where objects can no longer exist in high abundance without carrying selection and history inside them — below that boundary, random chemistry washes everything out; above it, causally self-reinforcing structures persist.
- Chirality — the property of molecules to come in mirror-image (left-handed and right-handed) forms — is not just an accidental feature of life's chemistry but a signature of crossing into complex chemical space.
- For molecules with fewer than roughly 7–11 heavy atoms, almost every molecule in chemical space is achiral (symmetric, like a spoon); above that threshold, almost every molecule is chiral — meaning chirality is a phase transition in assembly complexity, not a generic feature of chemistry.
- Choosing a chirality is not a spatial choice but a temporal one: selecting the left-handed form of a molecule commits the future of that chemical system for all time, because it determines which reactions are available to every subsequent molecule in that lineage.
- Walker's lab is working on the hypothesis that the origin-of-life transition coincides with the onset of chirality — the moment when chemistry is pushed complex enough that chiral molecules appear, enabling molecular recognition and autocatalytic feedback.
- The origin of life is not a one-time event in Walker's framework: it is a continuous process — the biosphere keeps crossing origin-of-life-like thresholds as it generates new combinatorial spaces (language, mathematics, technology) that achieve self-reinforcing structure.
- Embryogenesis — every multicellular organism passing through a single cell — is one of evolution's most underappreciated inventions: all cells share the same genome, so differentiation emerges from gene expression dynamics and physical interactions, not from genetic differences, and the mechanism is still poorly understood.
- Nick Lane's *Life Ascending* lists ten great inventions of evolution; Walker adds the germline bottleneck (every organism passing through a single cell) as profoundly underrated alongside sight, consciousness, and programmed cell death.

## Aliens and the Great Perceptual Filter

- Walker works directly on life-detection efforts, including contributing to biosignature science for NASA's planned Habitable Worlds Observatory mission for exoplanet detection.
- Her core argument: solving the origin of life and detecting alien life are the same problem — the first contact with alien life will likely occur in an origin-of-life experiment, not through a radio telescope.
- Walker suspects that sufficiently evolved biospheres virtualize themselves — packing more and more causal structure into a fixed volume of physical space, becoming increasingly abstract and temporally deep while barely expanding spatially.
- Freeman Dyson showed that an analog life form running exponentially slower over cosmic time could persist indefinitely against an exponentially expanding universe — Walker connects this to the idea that advanced intelligences may become undetectable by running out their computations in a temporally dense but spatially tiny form.
- Paul Davies proposed that advanced intelligences would build themselves into quantum computers operating in the vacuum of space to minimize dissipation, looking completely dark to the rest of the universe — Walker thinks the physics is wrong but the core insight may be partially correct.
- Walker has proposed that sufficiently advanced civilizations may resemble black holes to external observers — pinched-off causal structures that have virtualized their reality and closed themselves off from the rest of spacetime.
- The Great Perceptual Filter is Walker's analog to the Great Filter: as biospheres become more complex, they may become unable to perceive other complex biospheres — just as humans could not detect microbial life for most of history until microscopes were invented, despite microbes being everywhere and genetically very close to us.
- One of Walker's student projects models alien communication signals on firefly dynamics, using researcher Orit Peleg's GoPro-based firefly fieldwork to develop theories of how species maximize signal differentiation — then applying that logic to pulsars as a background against which an intentional alien signal might differentiate itself.
- Spreading to other planets requires solving the origin of life: seeding another planet with life means starting life from scratch there, which demands understanding the mechanism well enough to do it deliberately.

## Consciousness, Free Will, and Intelligence

- Walker's hypothesis on consciousness: the subjective experience of being conscious is a consequence of being a temporally extended object — consciousness is the large inner space of an entity that is enormous in time but tiny in space, experiencing its own causal depth.
- No two conscious entities occupy the same region of time: the reason my conscious experience is not identical to yours is that we are separated in time, having diverged from a shared causal history at some point — this is what makes individuals individuals.
- Walker distinguishes the hard problem of consciousness from the hard problem of life, calling life the harder problem because it requires a physical theory, not just a phenomenological account — assembly theory is her attempt to supply that physical theory.
- Free will is compatible with Walker's framework: a deterministic macroscopic object (a person) embedded in a fundamentally random quantum background has genuine novelty available at the tips of its possibility space — the future is always larger than the past.
- Free will is not instantaneous in Walker's view — moment-to-moment actions were already decided by prior causal structure; free will operates on longer time horizons, as the organism navigates its combinatorial future.
- Walker rejects many-worlds interpretation: rather than constant branching into parallel histories, she proposes that all those branches are already folded into the structure of what you are — you are the collapsed ensemble, and your deterministic macroscopic behavior is the result of that collapse.
- Intelligence, in Walker's framework, is a property of objects that are high-density configurations of selection — objects that not only arose through selection but now embody selection capacity and can actively select on possible futures.

## Artificial Life, LLMs, and the Technosphere

- Large language models are, in Walker's view, not a separate species but a crystallization of human language in physical form — a highly dynamic archive of the collective causal structure of human language, analogous to the evolution of the genome from primitive genetic fragments to the richly read-writable eukaryotic genome.
- Every new technology for storing language has been existentially traumatic: written language made it seem the dead were speaking; books threatened to dilute knowledge by making it widely available; LLMs disturb because they make language dynamic rather than static.
- Walker frames AI risk not as a rogue superintelligence scenario but as a co-evolutionary process between humans and technology — the actual near-term risks are deepfakes, autonomous weapons, child exploitation, and social manipulation, not a machine takeover.
- The technosphere is neither human nor technological — it is both, an integrated system in which humans and their technologies co-inhabit existence; treating AI as a separate species misrepresents the multilevel structure in which all of these things are embedded.
- Walker believes the current technological transition parallels the origin-of-life transition at the planetary scale: just as geochemistry transitioned to biology across scales from chemistry to planetary cycles, a transition is now underway from individual humans to global networked technology.
- The Kardashev scale misses the most important feature of advanced civilizations: energy consumption is secondary to creative expression and the exploration of possibility space — the most alien civilizations may be the ones that have most deeply virtualized themselves, not the ones consuming the most starlight.
- Walker considers computation a poor fundamental language for describing reality — it is what life invented, not what life runs on; saying the universe is computational confuses our capacity to build computers with a claim about base reality.
- Stephen Wolfram's ruliad (the entangled limit of all computationally possible processes) treats computation as fundamental; Walker argues computation is at the top of reality, not the bottom — it emerged after billions of years of evolution and does not occur in every physical object.
- A theory of everything that excludes the theorizer is not a theory of everything — David Krakauer's formulation: "A theory of everything is a theory of everything except those things that theorize."

## Mathematics, Language, and Existence

- Walker holds that mathematical objects are not Platonic entities existing outside the universe — they are features of our biosphere, products of human cognitive evolution, and are therefore objects to be studied empirically by physicists rather than used merely as tools.
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's work on undecidability are, in Walker's view, mathematics noticing holes in the universe — places where the open-ended combinatorial structure of mathematics produces irresolvable indeterminacy, analogous to what life does in chemistry.
- Meaning is an emergent property of recurrence and causal relationships among objects — words don't carry meaning intrinsically, but meaning arises from the regularities in how they are combined and how often certain combinations occur relative to others.
- Walker's core physicalist position: there is nothing outside the universe; even multiverse concepts and mathematical Platonism exist inside the universe as objects in human minds, and their causal role is in our biosphere, not in some external realm.
- The prime-mover question — why does anything exist at all? — is not answerable through the theory of life; understanding why certain things exist and others don't is answerable, but the existence of existence itself remains outside the reach of any physical theory she can imagine.
- Walker estimates humanity is in its "20s" in terms of scientific understanding, with the lifespan of understanding continuously extending — not a fixed percentage of a finite book, but a receding horizon as the universe itself grows in complexity and generates new questions.

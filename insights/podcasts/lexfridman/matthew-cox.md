# Matthew Cox: FBI Most Wanted Con Man - $55 Million in Bank Fraud | Lex Fridman Podcast #409

A nearly six-hour confession from a man who started by whiting out a 30-day-late rent payment and ended up fabricating entire people, fake banks, and inflated real estate markets before outrunning the US Marshals with a Starbucks latte in hand.

## The First Crime and How It Escalates

- Cox's first fraudulent act at age 29 was using whiteout to remove a borrower's 30-day-late rental history at Eagle Lending in Tampa, instructed by his manager Gretchen Zaas.
- His first fear was not jail but losing the commission — he was behind on his truck payment and mortgage and needed the deal to close.
- The loan closed without incident, which emboldened him; he immediately applied the same logic to the next file, inflating a W-2 from $45,000 to $51,000.
- His self-justification was "I'm doing God's work" — helping subprime borrowers who would otherwise be denied get into homes.
- He later reversed that rationalization in prison while writing an ethics and fraud course for the nation's mortgage brokers, concluding that some people should not own a house and that he was not smarter than the actuaries who wrote underwriting guidelines.
- The early fraud was invisible because subprime lenders competed aggressively — account executives arrived weekly to pitch "liar loans" requiring only a self-employment declaration for borrowers above a 700 credit score.
- By learning which checks underwriters ran (e.g., matching tax ID numbers against sunbiz.gov for W-2 employers), Cox reverse-engineered the detection system and closed around each checkpoint.

## Building Synthetic Identities

- Cox discovered that credit bureaus create a profile the first time someone applies for credit — prior to that, they have no record of the person.
- His method: obtain a child's Social Security number from client tax returns, apply for secured credit cards ($300–$500 deposits), and wait for a credit score to generate.
- He called the Social Security Administration dozens of times, iterating his cover story until landing on: "My infant son was born with a midwife, not in a hospital, and was never issued a number" — this triggered a process to apply in person.
- He forged a birth certificate on security paper, embossed it with a hand-worn "Richland County Office of Virtual Records" seal made with 220-grit sandpaper, and presented it at the SSA.
- At six months, the synthetic profiles generated 695–705 credit scores — well above the 620 minimum needed for a 95% LTV loan.
- He named the identities after Reservoir Dogs characters: James Red, Michael White, Lee Black, William Blue, David Silver, Brandon Green.
- Each identity had its own physical file folder with plastic sleeves for passports, driver's licenses, and documents; Cox would review the folder in his car before walking into a bank or closing.

## The Ybor City Property Scam

- Cox bought vacant houses in Tampa's Ybor City for $40,000–$60,000, paid a small documentary stamp premium (around $1,050 extra) to record the sale price at $190,000–$210,000, and used those inflated comparables to justify appraisals.
- He blackened windows and painted exteriors so properties looked acceptable from the curb for field reviews without revealing the interior condition.
- Synthetic-identity borrowers "purchased" the houses at inflated prices; the bank lent up to $190,000 on properties with $60,000 in actual costs, netting Cox roughly $60,000–$130,000 per transaction.
- At closings, Cox signed all documents himself in the parking lot, returned them to the title company, and claimed the borrower was unavailable.
- To silence collections when phantom borrowers stopped paying, Cox clipped real news articles about multi-car accidents, inserted the borrower's name, printed the result on newsprint, and had a fictional sibling write to creditors explaining the borrower was in a coma and would never work again.
- The FBI ultimately attributed 109 properties to the Ybor scam; a Forbes article later ranked that zip code among the top 20 fastest-appreciating areas in the country because Cox's inflated comparable sales artificially pumped valuations.
- Cox also manufactured the Bank of Ybor — a fake bank with a GoDaddy-built website and an 800 number voicemail — to verify bank statements and down payment reserves.

## Running an Organization and Getting Caught the First Time

- At peak operation Cox had roughly 15–20 people who "definitely knew this is fraud," including appraisers, title agents, real estate agents, and mortgage brokers who worked under him.
- Gretchen Zaas, his original manager, later wore a wire against him at a pizzeria meeting after her own indictment; Cox deduced this from the placement of her cell phones on the table and immediately changed his story.
- His ex-wife was the sole associate who never cooperated: every time the FBI or Secret Service arrived at her door, she told them to speak to her lawyer and said nothing.
- Cox's first arrest resulted in a plea to three years' federal probation, forfeiture of his brokerage license, and a consulting arrangement generating $9,000/month — not prison time.
- His lawyer offered a pre-trial intervention: hand over fraudulent files from his brokers, cooperate, and avoid indictment entirely. Cox refused on principle. Within years, every one of those brokers walked into the FBI voluntarily to cooperate against him.

## The Code of Silence and the Reality of Cooperation

- Cox calculates that 80–90% of federal defendants cooperate, yet in prison every inmate denies having done so.
- A prison corrections officer confirmed to Cox: "A hundred percent of them are lying about it."
- His thesis: demanding loyalty from criminals is incoherent — people who lie, cheat, and steal for a living have no moral infrastructure to support loyalty under pressure.
- The "stand-up guy" who takes 30 years gets no visits, his wife divorces him, his kids go into foster care, and his friends clean out his house — he ends up in the same halfway house as someone who cooperated for 10 years.
- Cox's original refusal to cooperate, motivated by Godfather-style omerta, he now views as narcissistic arrogance that made everything worse.
- The psychology of escalation: each successful fraud emboldened the next; the motivation shifted from desperation to narcissism — "Look how smart I am, I just handed a bank seven fraudulent documents and walked out with $250,000."

## Life on the Run: Identity Mechanics

- After a sheriff's deputy tipped him off that a task force was handing his case to the FBI, Cox left Tampa on a Sunday night with $80,000 in cash, drove to Atlanta, and began constructing a new life as Scott Kugno — a real client whose vital statistics Cox had socially engineered during a loan application.
- He conducted fake Salvation Army surveys on homeless people — fake federal form, clipboard, $20 cash incentive — to harvest names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, mother's maiden names, and criminal histories of people who would never intersect with the financial system.
- Over three years on the run Cox obtained 27 driver's licenses issued by state DMVs across seven states, more than two dozen passports, and held over 50 distinct identities.
- His documents always featured overkill: six supporting documents when three were required, including voter registration cards and high school transcripts, so DMV clerks felt they had more than enough.
- He got plastic surgery — a nose job, mini facelift, neck liposuction, two hair-graft procedures, and teeth work — to change his appearance after going on the run.
- To launder cash from multiple simultaneous refinancings (a "shotgunning scam"), Cox opened corporate bank accounts in the synthetic identities' names, then used cashier's checks between accounts to keep balances fluctuating rather than simply draining.
- At one point, a bank called Michael Shanahan's cell phone to verify a $29,000 check — Cox, sitting in the bank as Scott Cogno, answered as Shanahan and verified the check himself, then walked out with the cash.

## Close Calls and Near-Arrests

- While handcuffed in a South Carolina bank, Cox talked a detective out of arresting him by arguing that Wachovia's own loan officers must have made an error by approving overlapping first mortgages — and by pointing out that his Gary Sullivan ID (from a homeless man) showed valid in the NCIC database.
- Standing in a police station hallway, Cox spotted his own face on a Secret Service Most Wanted bulletin board pinned to the corkboard inches away.
- He outran two US Marshals from a Charlotte parking garage after apartment-complex staff recognized him and called out his location, escaping because his car was already running and there were no other vehicles in his path.
- His girlfriend Becky, diagnosed bipolar and frequently off her medication, nearly exposed him multiple times by screaming at 1 AM and attracting police — Cox eventually moved her to a separate apartment in the same building.
- Becky was ultimately caught in Houston after her mother called the Secret Service; Becky held her cover identity for 45 minutes until fingerprints confirmed her identity, then immediately told investigators where Cox was.

## Arrest, Sentencing, and the Federal Process

- Cox was arrested in Nashville in November 2006 after girlfriend Amanda's friend Trina called the Secret Service for a $10,000 reward; agents had surveilled the house for three days.
- At arrest, agents found multiple passports on his person; charges included bank fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, passport fraud, conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering — theoretically stackable to 150+ years.
- The FBI initially claimed $55 million in total losses; Cox's attorney negotiated the figure down to $15 million, then to $9.5 million in restitution, ultimately settling at $6 million owed.
- Sentencing enhancements for sophistication, more than 50 victims, jurisdictional evasion, and committing new crimes while on federal probation compounded his guidelines range from a base level to 26 years, 4 months (316 months).
- Cox cooperated with the Secret Service for seven days of interviews and with the FBI for three to four days, explaining every document-forgery technique, identity-building method, and social-engineering approach in detail.
- The US attorney verbally promised to consider Dateline interviews as "substantial assistance" — then acknowledged having considered it without reducing the sentence, teaching Cox that "consider" and "reduce" are distinct words.
- Secret Service agents Cox described as "overwhelmingly professional"; lead FBI agent Candace, 5'11" in heels, was described as one of the angriest people he ever met and universally described as a "bulldog" by other agents.

## Prison: Writing, Frank Amodeo, and the Rule 35

- Cox was sent to Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida — the largest federal complex in the nation.
- To avoid becoming a target, he followed the informal rules: never argue about the TV channel, return everything borrowed, do not run up gambling debts, be universally respectful.
- He took over a residential real estate continuing-education class because the previous instructor was too busy with legal work; this built his reputation and gave him structure.
- He wrote true-crime stories based on his fellow inmates' cases, passing hand-copied drafts around the compound; men who never read in their lives were reading his work and requesting follow-up stories.
- Frank Amodeo, a fellow inmate described as a former billionaire who attempted to take over the Democratic Republic of Congo, began doing pro-bono legal work for inmates and achieved multiple sentence reductions and immediate releases.
- Cox eventually worked with Amodeo on a legal motion and had his 26-year sentence reduced — ultimately serving 13 years before release.
- Cox wrote a book about Amodeo called "It's Insanity" and has pitched the story (also documented in a film called "9 Days in the Congo") as a film project.

## Post-Prison Life and Regret

- Cox left Coleman with 18 cents on his inmate account and $400 put there by a fellow inmate; his first purchase was $300 of clothes from Walmart.
- A childhood friend named Trion Colta gave him a minimum-wage gym job with 80-hour weeks available, which Cox used as a base to build his website and begin writing publicly.
- Inmates still inside pooled money to send Cox two laptops and a copy of Final Cut Pro so he could launch what became the Inside True Crime YouTube channel.
- His first video appearance was on the Koncrete Podcast with Danny Jones; that video received 2 million views, leading to invitations from Patrick Bet-David, Soft White Underbelly, and others.
- Cox's son, abandoned at age three when Cox fled Tampa, does not speak to him and has declined every attempt at reconciliation, including appeals from his adoptive father Nick and Cox's own ex-wife.
- His father died in prison before Cox's release but visited him and told him: "I'm not proud of where you ended up, but you've led an amazing, adventurous life, and I'm proud of you."
- His mother visited every two weeks for 13 years, including in a wheelchair after a stroke; Cox was released in time to spend her last 18 months with her and was holding her hand when she died.
- His summary of regret: "I would do anything to go back and just be that regular, middle-class guy with two kids and a wife, working a regular job. I just made one arrogant decision after another until it snowballed."
- He met his current wife at the halfway house — a former military police officer and hog-hunting guide who had done five years for a meth conspiracy; their date nights involve alligator hunting at Lake Okeechobee.

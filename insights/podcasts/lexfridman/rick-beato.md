# Rick Beato: Greatest Guitarists of All Time, History & Future of Music | Lex Fridman Podcast #492

A wide-ranging conversation with Rick Beato that moves from the anatomy of a great guitar solo through jazz history, perfect pitch science, and the AI disruption of music creation, to a candid account of fighting major-label Content ID claims for 10 years.

## Origins: Guitar Solos and Early Influences

- Beato's first guitar solo was Hey Joe (Hendrix), learned at 14 using E minor pentatonic, initially without knowing the scale's name
- His mother learned the E-C-G-D-A chord progression so she could play rhythm while he soloed — he credits this as formative parental support
- His father, not a musician, listened exclusively to sophisticated bebop jazz — Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Peterson — which shaped Beato's ears before he could articulate why
- Beato identifies Charlie Christian, Django Reinhardt, and Andrés Segovia as the three pre-Hendrix giants who defined 20th-century guitar influence
- Django Reinhardt played most of his fast solo lines with only two fingers — his ring finger and pinky were fused by a caravan fire
- Bebop's defining features: fast tempos, angular lines, chromaticism, and AABA chord form used as improvisation vehicles; Charlie Parker codified the language in the 1940s

## Perfect Pitch, Relative Pitch, and Early Musical Exposure

- Beato distinguishes perfect pitch (identifying any note without a reference) from relative pitch (identifying intervals from a stated reference note)
- Relative pitch is more practically useful for working musicians; Beato's ear-training course focuses exclusively on relative pitch
- His theory: all children are born with perfect pitch and begin losing it around nine months, when they become "culturally bound listeners"
- Research by Patricia Kuhl ("The Linguistic Genius of Babies") shows babies lose the ability to distinguish phonemes of non-native languages around nine months — Beato maps this directly to pitch perception
- Beato's son Dylan developed perfect pitch after prenatal exposure (starting at 15 weeks) to high-information music: Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Keith Jarrett, Turkish jazz pianist Aydan Esen
- Dylan at age 3.5 sang the Star Wars and Superman themes in the correct key unprompted; at the piano, the note B-flat made him say "Star Wars," the note G made him say "Superman"
- The Dylan perfect pitch video went viral on Facebook with ~80 million views and 250,000 comments before being uploaded to YouTube
- At age 8, Dylan correctly identified polychords including "C augmented over D-flat augmented" and "A-flat major over A major" in inversion — Beato had to check his own hands to verify the voicings
- Social engagement is a necessary condition: Beato played music for Dylan while making eye contact, because language (and pitch) acquisition requires activating the social brain

## Learning Guitar: Practical Pedagogy

- Start with open chords in first position; the hardest early challenge is arching fingers so adjacent open strings ring cleanly
- Practice 10 minutes a day every day rather than one hour once a week — consistency builds neural pathways more efficiently
- Keep a guitar on a stand in plain sight: visual accessibility converts 10-second impulse touches into hour-long practice sessions
- Learn songs first to maintain motivation; add scales and music theory only after falling in love with playing
- By ear, Beato learned Joe Pass's entire "Virtuoso" (1973) as a teenager by moving the needle back and forth on the record until he could replicate each chord shape — he had no idea what the chords were called
- The struggle of figuring out music by ear is itself a developmental tool, not inefficiency to be eliminated

## Miles Davis and the Philosophy of Jazz

- Miles Davis was the greatest innovator in jazz history — he led the bebop quintet (with Coltrane), the modal jazz era, hard bop, and fusion (Bitches Brew)
- The '50s quintet: John Coltrane, Paul Chambers (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums); the '60s quintet: Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter
- Ron Carter confirmed to Beato that Miles never rehearsed in the studio — musicians showed up, received charts, and recorded immediately
- Miles's sidemen often did not know they were being recorded; Carter would learn he'd appeared on an album only when he took it to the union office months later to claim payment
- Drummer Vinnie Colaiuta's summation of Miles's philosophy: "Thought is the enemy of flow"
- Flea (RHCP) was shaped by jazz because his stepfather was a jazz bass player who held jam sessions at home — the same pattern of early environmental immersion Beato identifies in his own development

## Greatest Guitar Solos and What Makes Genius Tone

- Beato's top list (subject to daily change): Comfortably Numb solo 1 (Pink Floyd), Stairway to Heaven (Led Zeppelin), Hey Joe (Hendrix), Kid Charlemagne (Steely Dan / Larry Carlton), Stone in Love (Journey / Neal Schon), Sultans of Swing (Dire Straits / Mark Knopfler)
- He deliberately ranks the underappreciated Comfortably Numb first solo above the famous second because "nobody talks about that solo"
- David Gilmour's genius: melodic sense — how one phrase leads to the next with space between them, analogous to great spoken sentences
- Gilmour's signal chain still uses original hardware: a Binson Echorec and original effects pedals from the recordings; his tech Phil has been with him ~50 years
- Gilmour records solos at home using a Zoom 9030 (1990s amp modeler) running into Pro Tools that he operates himself — a detail Beato confirmed on camera with Gilmour present
- Mark Knopfler achieves the cleanest single-note tone of any living guitarist in Beato's view — identifiable from a single bent note; used Nashville tuning on a Strat to write Comfortably Numb's chorus
- Every player Beato names is identifiable by one note: B.B. King's vibrato, Brian May's tone, Van Halen's attack — unique tone is the marker of true greatness
- Van Halen's "Ice Cream Man" opening lick is so physically demanding (extreme stretch, unusual thumb position) that Dweezil Zappa and Phil X both said they'd need dedicated practice time to replicate it

## 27 Club, Drugs, and the Dark Side of Creative Life

- 27 Club members discussed: Hendrix, Brian Jones, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain
- Smoking was universal among musicians until recently — Beato's son Dylan's high school has essentially zero smokers; Nat King Cole smoked four packs a day and died of lung cancer; McCartney, Lennon, Sinatra, Miles Davis all smoked heavily
- Beato speculates that smoking contributed to distinctive vocal raspiness and texture, making it a double-edged cultural tool rather than merely destructive
- The dopamine arc of live performance — 100,000-person adoration followed by isolation — creates a neurobiological vulnerability that makes drug abuse structurally likely for touring musicians
- Beato's theory on creative peak: fluid intelligence (improvisation, novel songwriting) peaks in the late 20s; crystallized intelligence (life-experience-based composition) enables composers like Bach and Beethoven to produce their greatest works late in life

## Songwriting Process: Elton John, Beatles, Billy Corgan

- Elton John writes melody to lyrics, not lyrics to melody — the reverse of ~99% of songwriters; Bernie Taupin delivers a lyric sheet and Elton composes the melody live in 15 minutes
- The Beatles recorded Help!, Rubber Soul, and Revolver within 365 days (August 1965 – August 1966) — Beato attributes this partly to being forced off the road because PA systems were too primitive to hear themselves at Shea Stadium
- Beatles' Hamburg years (8-hour sets, 5 nights a week) gave them concentrated craft development that explains their emotional range despite their youth
- Beato's theory on The Beatles: four supremely talented musicians plus George Martin at exactly the right moment constitutes a "perfect storm" rather than a formula
- Billy Corgan told Beato the secret to his melancholy sound is "the seventh and the ninth" — notes outside the chord that create dissonance; Beato generalizes: "Dissonance equals emotion"
- Sting described the bridge as "therapy" in a song — a place to change the frame of reference; Beato notes the Beatles used bridges for tonal contrast between Lennon and McCartney perspectives within a single song
- Brian May revealed to Beato that in Bohemian Rhapsody's final section, a whammy bar dip made the piano sound slightly out of tune — it always bothered him; the greatest recordings contain small imperfections that only their creators hear

## Beethoven and Bach

- Beethoven was completely deaf before beginning the Ninth Symphony; he composed it by editing entirely in his head, a process Beato finds almost incomprehensible given the orchestral scale
- The Heiligenstadt Testament (1802 letter found in Beethoven's desk after his death) reveals his shame and humiliation at being unable to hear a flute or a shepherd singing — "of all the people, why him?"
- Beethoven pressed a stick between his teeth and rested it on the piano soundboard to feel vibrations through bone conduction
- The Ninth Symphony's arc — from chaos and conflict to Ode to Joy — was composed against a backdrop of post-Napoleonic disillusionment, before the American Civil War and two World Wars
- Bach is cited by virtually every major songwriter Beato has interviewed as a daily reference; Sting and Dominic Miller both practice Bach regularly
- Mendelssohn, age 20, staged the premiere of Bach's St. Matthew Passion in Berlin in 1829, decades after Bach's death — the performance catalyzed Bach's modern reputation
- Bach lost both parents within nine months of each other at age 9, had 20 children (10 survived to adulthood), and wrote the most complex contrapuntal music in history

## AI in Music

- Beato experimented with Suno for song generation; his workflow: lyrics written in Claude ("way better at lyrics than Suno"), images in ChatGPT, then lyrics imported into Suno
- Out of approximately 130 AI-generated song ideas, he considers roughly 3 genuinely good — recognizing quality requires the judgment only experienced musicians have
- His daughter Layla (a teenager) could instantly detect AI music artifacts in 2023 by the ringing reverb tail on vocals; by 2024–2025 the same daughter said "this is getting better" when listening to isolated vocals
- AI music tools are largely trained on low-bitrate MP3s; major-label deals for high-quality WAV multitracks will significantly improve output fidelity
- Beato's core objection to using AI for his own music: "It's boring" — the process of prompting and selecting is not the creative process he cares about
- Both Beato and Lex agree that AI slop is fundamentally boring regardless of technical quality — audiences rapidly recognize and disengage from it
- AI tools are productively used in Beato's workflow for audio stem separation: splitting voice bleed from live instrument tracks in interview recordings

## YouTube Copyright Battles and Spotify

- Beato's channel (started June 2016, approximately 10 years old) has faced Content ID claims since day one from WMG, UMG, and other major labels — anything from Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin triggered automatic blocks or demonetization
- Demonetization mechanics: using 20 seconds of a clip in a one-hour video gives the label 100% of ad revenue from the entire video
- A viral 2020 TikTok (skateboarder + Ocean Spray + Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams") caused labels to reconsider blocking, shifting to demonetization as strategy
- Beato hired a lawyer who has fought 4,000 Content ID claims on his 2,100-video catalog — winning every single one — and will appear in a forthcoming public interview on the channel
- Labels use third-party AI-detection firms that target large channels first for maximum revenue extraction; most YouTubers historically did not fight back out of fear of strikes
- Spotify critique: it commoditizes music ("like turning on a water faucet"), algorithms pigeonhole listeners into one genre rather than exposing them to radio-style unexpected discoveries, and podcast streams now share the royalty pool with music
- Beato still uses original WAV files ripped from CDs in 2005 for his interview segments — original-encoding files sound noticeably better than Spotify's remastered streams, which add artificial high-end

## Gear, Career Arc, and Advice

- Beato owns approximately 95–100 physical amplifiers, each selected because it "does one thing really well": Marshall JCM800 for mids, Mesa/Boogie for scooped metal, Vox AC30 for chime; he routinely tests new amps by playing Master of Puppets
- His signature instrument is a double-cutaway Gibson Les Paul Special with P-90 pickups; he also owns a 1957 Gibson Country Western acoustic (held for 30+ years) and a Martin D-28
- Pro Tools is his primary DAW (industry standard); he also uses Logic and Ableton, and Neural DSP for amp simulation when traveling
- Career sequence: undergrad in classical bass, master's in jazz guitar from New England Conservatory, 5 years teaching jazz studies (1987–1992), publishing deal with PolyGram in 1992, record producer from age 37, YouTube from 2016
- He refused to be photographed for his entire production career (1999–2015) — virtually no images of him exist online from that era
- The YouTube channel began as a response to the viral Dylan perfect pitch video — so many pro musicians and conservatories emailed asking "how did you teach him that?" that he started making videos to avoid repeating himself
- His advice on public creative work: make videos about what genuinely interests you; people who share your interests will find them — chasing fame before mastery produces unfulfilling, short-lived results
- He talks to his siblings multiple times a week and maintains friendships across every decade of his life — "Nothing means anything more than the friendships you make and your family"

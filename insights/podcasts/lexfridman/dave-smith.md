# Dave Smith: Israel, Ukraine, Epstein, Mossad, Conspiracies & Antisemitism | Lex Fridman Podcast #464

A three-hour confrontation between libertarian anti-war absolutism and Lex Fridman's more institution-sympathetic skepticism, covering every flashpoint where U.S. foreign policy, intelligence agencies, and media propaganda intersect.

## Libertarianism and Its Variants

- Dave Smith aligns closest with Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism, placing himself slightly to the left of minarchist Ron Paul on the role of any government.
- He distinguishes three camps: the Ayn Rand / Milton Friedman / Thomas Sowell mainstream, the Ron Paul foreign-policy-centered school, and the Rothbard anarcho-capitalist strand.
- Ron Paul's singular contribution was combining opposition to big government at home and abroad, a synthesis that neither mainstream left nor right offered in the 2000s.
- Smith credits Paul's 2008 and 2012 campaigns with laying the cultural groundwork that allowed Trump to attack Jeb Bush on Iraq at the South Carolina debate to applause from former Bush voters.
- Ron Paul was the only congressman whose office lobbyists stopped visiting because no pitch ever moved him; Smith treats this as evidence of rare genuine integrity in DC.
- Paul delivered thousands of babies as a country doctor, was married to the same woman for over sixty years, and served in the Air Force — Smith invokes these facts as markers of a coherent, non-performative character.

## Military-Industrial Complex and Manufactured Consent

- Smith argues the complex comprises not just weapons manufacturers but intelligence agencies and media outlets that parrot their talking points, forming a single propaganda apparatus.
- In 1990 no organic American sentiment existed about Saddam Hussein's dispute with Kuwait over slant drilling; the desire for that war was entirely manufactured top-down.
- He quotes neocon Jonah Goldberg approvingly paraphrasing Charles Krauthammer: America needs to find a "puny little country" every ten years and put them against a wall to demonstrate credibility — Smith calls this the actual operative mentality, not defense of freedom.
- Neocon writings in the 1990s, when they were out of power and less guarded, openly discussed requiring a "Pearl Harbor-style event" to build public support for Middle East wars — the PNAC document is the specific reference.
- Smith says shows like Rogan's and Fridman's broke the monopoly where CBS, NBC, ABC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post could move the nation in unison, as they did throughout 2002 in the Iraq buildup.

## War on Terror and Blowback

- Smith's radicalization came from Ron Paul explaining "blowback" in 2007 when Smith was 24: the U.S. putting military bases in Muslim holy land and propping up dictatorships, not hatred of American freedom, explains anti-American terrorism.
- Pat Buchanan's formulation: the idea that Osama bin Laden stumbled on the Bill of Rights and decided to blow himself up over speedy trials is incoherent.
- General Stanley McChrystal coined "insurgent math" — 10 minus 2 equals 20 — to describe how every targeted killing recruits more fighters than it removes.
- The Obama drone campaign in Yemen from 2009 to 2015 targeted Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; during that period AQAP continuously grew because 96% of those killed in "targeted" strikes were civilians.
- Smith's heuristic: if someone killed his kids he could understand becoming nearly a terrorist himself, which is why he refuses to moralize about Palestinian or Iraqi responses to occupation without acknowledging this universal human dynamic.
- Brett Stephens's New York Times piece on the 20th anniversary of the Iraq invasion never mentioned the roughly one million dead or the twenty million displaced — it only compared life under Saddam vs. the post-war Shiite system.

## Just War Theory

- Smith's framework: you never have a right to kill innocent people, but in extremis you might be forced to — the moral weight of that act still remains, and spiking the football afterward is obscene.
- He uses a simplified WWII thought experiment: even if only one eight-year-old girl died to stop the Nazis, the correct response is permanent solemnity, not "rah-rah we were the good ones."
- "Hamas must go" is not a valid moral starting point; you can argue that about Kim Jong-Un, Netanyahu, or Putin without thereby authorizing killing all their populations.
- The aggressor-in-a-bar analogy: if someone spits in your face and you shoot them, you are not justified — but if you ask why it happened, the spitting is the causal explanation. Smith applies this framework to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- The school-shooter analogy against Israeli tactics: if a shooter is in a school, "blow up the school because he's using human shields" would never be accepted domestically — it should not be accepted in war either.

## Israel, Gaza, and October 7th

- October 7th was, Smith argues, simultaneously indefensible terrorism and an indictment of Netanyahu's entire security strategy as the longest-serving Israeli prime minister who ran on being "tough on Palestinians."
- Netanyahu explicitly told Likud members his strategy was to "prop up" and "bolster" Hamas, using Qatar cash delivered in briefcases through Mossad channels, to prevent a unified Palestinian leadership that would pressure Israel toward a two-state deal.
- Israel maintained a full blockade on Gaza since 2007, refusing potatoes and sugar as "dual use," while simultaneously routing cash to Hamas — Smith calls this an incoherent policy revealing bad faith.
- Israel's 1967 occupation has lasted over 60 years across a strip 5 miles by 25 miles where Palestinians have no airport (Israel bombed it), no seaport, no freedom of movement, no voting rights in the government that controls them — Smith says this is definitionally an apartheid state, not a democracy.
- The founding of Israel involved the forced displacement of 700,000 to 800,000 Arabs; Benny Morris's own writing acknowledged "transfer" was always known to be necessary for a Jewish majority state.
- Egypt and Israel fought four wars in two decades, then made a land-for-peace deal in the late 1970s and have not fought since — Smith uses this as evidence that resolution is possible.
- Douglas Murray's framing of "democracy vs. death cult" fails because Israel has 5 to 6 million people under its control who cannot vote; calling it a democracy is gaming a system entered through force.
- Support for Hamas in polling data consistently drops when peace talks progress and rises when military campaigns intensify — Smith cites this as empirical confirmation of blowback dynamics.

## Darryl Cooper, Churchill, and World War II

- Darryl Cooper (Martyr Made podcast) told Tucker Carlson that Churchill was "the chief villain of WWII" as a deliberate provocation to argue the war might have remained a limited Polish invasion rather than a civilizational catastrophe.
- Smith defends Cooper against Nazi-sympathizer accusations, describing his long-form historical work as rigorously responsible — Cooper's WWII series was in production at the time of the recording.
- Fridman disagrees specifically on Churchill, arguing the Soviet invasion and global escalation would have happened regardless; Smith frames it as a legitimate historical debate worth having.
- Smith's meta-point: regardless of whether WWII was justified, the lesson "appeasement is always wrong and aggression is good" does not follow, yet that is how the war is consistently weaponized by neocons.
- The Hitler comparison has been used for Saddam, Gaddafi, Assad, Putin, and Trump — Smith argues this rhetorical move prevents diplomatic engagement by making every adversary a monster with whom negotiation is impossible.

## Jeffrey Epstein and Institutional Failure

- Alex Acosta's statement that he was told by the intelligence community that Epstein "is intelligence" and to "go easy on him" is Smith's central piece of evidence for state involvement.
- Epstein's career trajectory — high school teacher at Dalton to Bear Stearns partner worth hundreds of millions within two years, with no traceable income source — is, Smith argues, inexplicable outside an intelligence connection.
- The ABC reporter who had the full story and was told to kill it by the network because of "relationships with the royal family" did not resign; the correctional officers at the most secure prison in America filed no logs the night Epstein died.
- Pam Bondi announced all Epstein files would be released except what is "redacted for national security" — Smith calls this incoherent, asking what a pedophile blackmail ring has to do with national security.
- Tucker Carlson's question: everyone is discussing flight logs and files but no one is asking about the actual surveillance tapes Epstein clearly used to blackmail clients.
- Smith's systemic indictment: the Iraq war liars, the COVID lockdown architects, and the vaccine-mandate enforcers all kept their jobs and social standing — Epstein fits the same pattern of total institutional impunity.

## Ukraine, Russia, and NATO

- Smith agrees Putin is morally responsible for launching the invasion of February 2022 and for the hundreds of thousands of casualties — he is emphatic that this is not in dispute.
- NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg admitted that in late 2021 Putin sent a draft treaty offering not to invade if NATO put in writing that Ukraine would not join; Stoltenberg refused and later bragged that Putin got "more NATO expansion" as a result.
- William Burns's 2008 cable "Nyet Means Nyet," later released by WikiLeaks, warned Condoleezza Rice that pushing Ukrainian NATO membership could provoke a civil war and Russian intervention — "a decision Russia does not want to have to make."
- George Kennan warned in 1998 that NATO expansion after the Soviet collapse was the worst possible policy and predicted that advocates would eventually point to the Russian reaction as vindication of their expansion.
- Smith's Cuba Missile Crisis analogy: no U.S. administration from Jefferson through Biden would tolerate a rival great power backing a coup in Mexico and then offering that country military alliance membership.
- Biden contradicted his own White House four times by publicly stating the U.S. would militarily intervene if China invaded Taiwan, only to be corrected each time by unnamed White House officials reaffirming the One China policy.
- In war games, the U.S. loses a conventional conflict over Taiwan to China in almost every simulation; Smith argues this makes the hawkish posture toward China militarily as well as diplomatically irresponsible.
- Trump put his political capital on ending the Ukraine war quickly, which Smith sees as a genuine incentive structure that distinguishes Trump's approach from Biden's no-off-ramp policy.

## Antisemitism, Online Dynamics, and the Israel Debate

- Smith is Jewish; he describes being called a "self-hating Jew" and "Nazi apologist" solely for criticizing Israel's conduct in Gaza.
- He distinguishes three distinct phenomena being conflated under "antisemitism": actual Jew-hatred, legitimate criticism of Israeli policy, and bad-faith trolling for engagement.
- Young white men who grew up under progressive identity politics are now playing the same racialized grievance game they were excluded from — Smith says this was a predictable consequence of woke racialism, not a cause external to it.
- The rise of visible antisemitism on X correlates with Israel's Gaza campaign; even if individual Jew-haters would exist regardless, the campaign is the "recruiting shtick" that amplifies their numbers.
- Smith's frustration with Jew-hating commenters in his mentions: they are tactically indistinguishable from Mossad plants because they instantly discredit all criticism of Israeli policy.
- He argues Jewish Americans are 2% of the population and "thriving by any metric" — comparing mean tweets to Nazi Germany he calls hysterical and counterproductive.

## Joe Rogan, Podcasting, and the Media Landscape

- Smith was a Rogan fan before the JRE existed, visiting joerogan.net and watching the Carlos Mencia confrontation video; he predicted the podcast would be big from episode one.
- Rogan first had Smith on in 2016 when Smith had approximately 5,000 followers — Smith calls this generosity without self-interest the defining quality of Rogan's character.
- Smith's theory of the parasocial relationship threshold: 40 to 50 hours of consuming someone in long-form unguarded conversation allows you to "see into their soul," and audiences will notice if the subject is guarded.
- Kamala Harris's correct instinct was not to do Rogan — her total guardedness in every interview meant three hours of long-form would have exposed her inauthenticity in high definition.
- The old model — a comedian does seven minutes on Letterman, audiences have no way to connect — is structurally incompatible with the current parasocial model where three hours creates a quasi-friendship.
- Fridman sets his threshold for relationship formation at 20 to 50 hours of content consumed; Smith agrees, putting it at 40 to 50 hours.
- Politicians discovering podcasts late is Smith's primary example of media institutional lag: the audience moved to long-form internet shows, but candidates kept doing 90-minute debates with 90-second answers until Trump broke the pattern.

## Conspiracy Theories, Epistemics, and Hope

- Smith's framework for evaluating conspiracy claims: "evidence-sy" is not evidence — the PNAC document saying they wanted a Pearl Harbor event does not prove they staged 9/11; it shows they exploited it.
- Larry Silverstein's large World Trade Center insurance policy is regularly cited as 9/11 evidence; Smith points out the same building had been the target of a terrorist attack in 1993, making a large policy unremarkable.
- Smith's rule: when you feel the pleasure of a piece of evidence confirming your priors, that is the moment to be ten times more skeptical, not less.
- Gene Epstein's "radical optimism" case: in 1845 predicting slavery abolished in 20 years would have sounded insane; in 1981 predicting the Soviet Union gone in 10 years would have sounded insane — both happened.
- During COVID, Smith feared the platform crackdowns would permanently narrow the information ecosystem; he now counts the reversal — Elon Musk buying Twitter, alternative media surviving — as evidence that the regime lost its monopoly on propaganda.
- The 2002 Iraq propaganda campaign could not be replicated today: Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson would have critics on within days, and neither can be pressured by advertisers or networks to suppress them.
- Smith's son was born with a congenital heart defect and had open-heart surgery at three days old; twenty years ago the child would have died — modern medical technology is his personal, non-abstract reason for rejecting nostalgia and embracing qualified optimism.

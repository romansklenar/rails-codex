# Norman Ohler: Hitler, Nazis, Drugs, WW2, Blitzkrieg, LSD, MKUltra & CIA | Lex Fridman Podcast #481

A novelist-turned-historian reconstructs the drug-saturated interior of the Third Reich using primary-source archives that credentialed historians had never mined through a pharmacological lens.

## Weimar Germany and the Drug Culture That Preceded the Nazis

- Post-WWI Berlin saw mass drug use — morphine, cocaine, mescaline, ether — driven by economic collapse from the Versailles Treaty and the sudden absence of imperial authority.
- The Munich beer halls where the Nazi movement incubated ran on alcohol, which Ohler argues neurologically primes group aggression and susceptibility to right-wing populism.
- Hitler was a teetotaler and non-smoker; his sobriety was a deliberate political performance and gave him a psychological edge over drunk followers.
- Goebbels called Berlin's drug scene the "hated asphalt reality of Berlin" — the cultural rift between Munich (alcohol, nationalism) and Berlin (drugs, LGBTQ bohemia) was a defining fault line.
- When the Nazis took power in January 1933, drug users were among the first sent to early SA-run concentration camps in cellars; ideological intoxication replaced chemical intoxication.

## The Origins of Pervitin: Methamphetamine as a Nazi Performance Drug

- The Temmler pharmaceutical company synthesized methamphetamine in 1937–38 after its head concluded Jesse Owens must have used Benzedrine to beat German athletes at the 1936 Olympics.
- Temmler chemist Fritz Hauschild re-synthesized a 1917 Japanese formula, tested it internally among staff, and patented the product as Pervitin — available in any German pharmacy without prescription.
- Pervitin was marketed as a performance enhancer, not a drug; university clinical trials reported it eliminated fear, suppressed appetite, and extended wakefulness — ideal soldier attributes.
- Nazi ideology formally opposed drugs but used semantic sleight of hand to classify Pervitin as a medicine; the first public negative reports appeared only in 1940, from a relative of Albert Speer.
- Professor Otto Ranke, head of the Institute for Army Physiology, ran controlled comparisons (methamphetamine vs. caffeine vs. placebo, starting at 8 PM) and found Pervitin subjects were still energetic and sociable at 10 AM while caffeine subjects were asleep on benches.

## Methamphetamine and the French Campaign (Blitzkrieg, May 1940)

- The Ardennes plan was conceived by three tank generals — Rommel, von Manstein, Guderian — who argued tanks should be used as race cars at the front rather than slow support weapons in the rear.
- The plan required reaching Sedan in three days and three nights without stopping — biologically impossible without pharmacological sleep suppression.
- Temmler delivered 35 million dosages of Pervitin to troops before May 10, 1940; Ranke issued a formal "stimulant decree" specifying dosage, intervals, and side effects across the entire army.
- Meth created a party atmosphere inside the tanks — soldiers in a depressed pre-attack mood shifted to euphoric fight-or-flight readiness within an hour of dosing.
- Rommel's 7th Panzer Division used the highest per-division meth allocation; Rommel's documented behavior (standing in the open tank hatch at night, driving through sleeping French encampments) is consistent with stimulant intoxication.
- French soldiers received three-quarters of a liter of red wine per man per day; the asymmetry — drunk infantry sleeping vs. meth-fueled tanks driving through them at night — produced documented war crimes, with tank treads described as becoming bloody.
- France fell in six weeks; the campaign is considered Germany's single greatest military success.

## Dunkirk: Hitler's Halt Order and the Role of Drugs

- With the British Expeditionary Force encircled, the Wehrmacht could have closed Dunkirk and captured or destroyed the entire British Army.
- Hitler issued the Halte Befehl (halt order), partly because tank generals' unconventional meth-fueled speed made him fear unprotected flanks — he was mentally fighting WWI while his army fought a new kind of war.
- Göring, addicted to morphine since a stomach wound at the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, convinced Hitler that the Luftwaffe alone could finish the job from the air — a grandiose promise impossible to deliver.
- The halt order allowed 338,000 Allied troops to evacuate; von Manstein later called the Western campaign a "lost victory."
- Göring's morphine addiction is documented; he was captured by Americans in 1945 carrying a large cache of morphine capsules, went through withdrawal in custody, and appeared at Nuremberg as a haggard, physically diminished version of himself.

## Dr. Theodor Morell and Hitler's Drug Escalation (1936–1945)

- Morell was a Berlin celebrity "Dr. Feelgood" on Kurfürstendamm — a VIP-medicine practitioner who gave injections to opera stars before performances; he came to Hitler through Hitler's photographer Heinrich Hoffmann.
- Morell first won Hitler's trust by curing his severe bloating with Mutaflor, a probiotic based on gut bacteria isolated from a WWI-era Serbian campaign soldier with unusual intestinal resilience.
- From 1936 to 1941, Morell injected only vitamins and glucose; Hitler never fell sick and trained his arm muscles specifically to sustain the Heil Hitler salute during long military parades.
- Hitler's first opioid exposure came in August 1941 — he had Russian flu and couldn't attend a critical military briefing where the decision on whether to advance to Moscow was made; Morell injected Dolantin (meperidine) intravenously.
- Energized by the Dolantin injection, Hitler dominated the meeting and ordered the forces split toward Leningrad and southern oil fields instead of maintaining the thrust toward Moscow — widely regarded as one of the war's decisive strategic blunders.
- Morell ran Hamma Pharmaceuticals from a factory in occupied Czechoslovakia, monopolizing organs from Ukrainian slaughterhouses to manufacture hormonal concoctions; he used Hitler as a guinea pig who would then legally authorize new products by decree.
- Hitler and Morell's relationship was secret, intimate, and mutually reinforcing: Morell grew wealthy; Hitler gained pharmacological performance; neither used the word "drugs."

## Hitler's Full Drug Cocktail: Eukodal, Cocaine, and the Speedball

- Eukodal (oxycodone), produced by Merck Darmstadt, became Hitler's primary drug starting July 1943; its US patent was confiscated after WWII and became the molecule behind OxyContin.
- Hitler first received Eukodal before a meeting with Mussolini, who wanted Italy to exit the Axis; dosed on two intravenous injections, Hitler spoke nonstop for two hours and Mussolini was unable to interject even once.
- By September 1944, Hitler took Eukodal every other day — a classic junkie rhythm of use/recovery cycles.
- After the July 1944 Stauffenberg bomb attack, ear-nose-throat specialist Dr. Keesing administered cocaine as a topical anesthetic for Hitler's blown eardrums; Hitler immediately demanded intranasal application and responded with an ego-amplifying rush.
- Cocaine and Eukodal were administered in close succession — the stimulant/depressant "speedball" combination (also what killed John Belushi and Chris Farley) — the drug regime of someone at the end of a long addiction.
- Merck's Eukodal factory was destroyed by British bombers in December 1944; Morell rode a motorcycle through bombed-out Berlin pharmacy to pharmacy unable to find replacement stock; Hitler went into opioid withdrawal in the bunker.
- In late April 1945, Hitler reportedly put a gun to Morell's head, accused him of creating his addiction, and expelled him from the bunker; Morell escaped on one of the last planes out of Berlin, did his taxes alone in a Bavarian research lab, was captured by Americans, and died in 1947 dumped outside Munich train station in an ill-fitting uniform.

## The German Resistance: Harro Schulze-Boysen and the Bohemians

- Ohler discovered Harro Schulze-Boysen's story accidentally while researching Luftwaffe drug files in a Munich archive; a final letter to Harro's father expressing clear conscience and conviction was the entry point.
- Harro, great-grand-nephew of Admiral von Tirpitz, built a 100-person resistance network in Berlin spanning artists, workers, leftists, and patriots — the most diverse internal resistance group of the Nazi era.
- His recruitment method was biweekly parties at a loft apartment off the Ku'damm; he would make a mildly critical remark about the regime and observe whether the person engaged, retreated, or reported him.
- Harro worked inside the Luftwaffe Ministry and passed operational intelligence to British and Soviet contacts — including Germany's covert role in Spain's Civil War, which a BBC journalist buried out of fear.
- The network was caught when the Soviet Union sent a radio message to Harro's address in plaintext (or deliberately identified him — possibly a Stalin-era betrayal), allowing the Gestapo to decode the communication.
- Libertas Schulze-Boysen was deceived into confiding in a Gestapo secretary posing as a sympathetic friend, which broke the network's operational security.
- Harro and Libertas were executed in December 1942; the SS had carved swastikas into Harro's thighs with knives during his 1933 arrest — scars he hid from Libertas on the night they met on the Wannsee.

## LSD, the CIA, and MKUltra: The Pharmacological Cold War

- Albert Hofmann at Sandoz synthesized LSD from ergot fungus in 1943; the company set up an in-house "intoxication room" where employees voluntarily tried it — all reported euphoria, laughter, heightened sensitivity.
- Nazi biochemist Richard Kuhn received ergotamine (LSD precursor) from Sandoz CEO Arthur Stoll in October 1943; the SS ran LSD and mescaline experiments at Dachau seeking a truth drug — the US Alsos unit interrogated Kuhn at liberation and flew the results directly to the Pentagon.
- Within two years the CIA had LSD and launched MKULTRA — formally in 1947, the year the CIA was founded — framing it as counter-Soviet brain warfare without Congressional authorization.
- Sidney Gottlieb, MKULTRA director, visited Sandoz CEO Stoll with $240,000 to buy what he believed was 400 kg of LSD; Stoll corrected him — it was 400 grams — but sold the entire supply, agreeing to restrict LSD to research use under CIA/FDA pressure.
- MKULTRA spilled into the counterculture when Ken Kesey received $75 per session to take LSD for the CIA at a Menlo Park psychiatric ward and used the experience to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
- LSD was scheduled as illegal in 1966 not because of safety failures in legitimate research but because Gottlieb wanted exclusive control; the CIA's program was a direct continuation of Nazi human experimentation methodology.
- Ohler bribed the Novartis archivist (who held the Sandoz/Stoll papers) with a vintage LSD tab printed with the original 1940s Sandoz logo, unlocking the Stoll–Kuhn correspondence that confirmed the Nazi–CIA LSD lineage.

## Stoned Sapiens: Drugs as the Engine of Human Cognitive Evolution

- Homo erectus in the Great Rift Valley lived alongside khat — a plant amphetamine still chewed across Ethiopia and Yemen — and shed fur to develop sweat glands, enabling persistence hunting by jogging animals to exhaustion.
- Ohler's "stoned ape" thesis traces early Homo sapiens migration through the Central African rainforest where iboga grows; elephants visibly intoxicate themselves on iboga root, and a Columbia University researcher describes iboga as acting "like a spa for neurons" — targeting depression loops and addiction pathways with precision that suggests evolutionary co-adaptation.
- At Gobekli Tepe (~10,000 BCE), isolated groups gathered for 1,600 years — the first 800 without beer, the next 800 with it; alcohol enabled the emergence of temple-controlled beer production, which Ohler identifies as the origin of hierarchical social structure.
- The Minoan high culture on Crete — Europe's first — appears to have been funded by a double export monopoly: olive oil and opium, traded through a massive harbor whose ruins Ohler physically excavated while on vacation.
- Moses's burning-bush revelation maps onto an Egyptian acacia (DMT-containing) trip by a fugitive traumatized man fasting in the Sinai desert; Israeli scholars note the passage mentions acacia multiple times, and "you shall not kill" as a commandment is coherent with someone processing the guilt of having killed a man.
- Neanderthal cave art is consistently simpler than Homo sapiens cave art; Ohler argues psychedelic experience gave sapiens the neuroplastic advantage that allowed them to outcompete and absorb Neanderthals — who were "too sober for the future."

## LSD as Personal and Creative Practice

- Ohler's first LSD experience was in 1993 in pre-gentrified Lower Manhattan; the trip included apparent hallucinations of a gang killing and a full racial riot on 2nd Avenue — he was convinced for hours he had permanently damaged his brain.
- He distinguishes microdosing (10–20 micrograms, no perceptual change), a trip dose (100 micrograms, color intensification), and a high dose (200+ micrograms, full experience); he swam for three hours in the Thai ocean at 200 micrograms.
- LSD docks to approximately nine receptor types in the brain versus psilocybin's five, according to a Zurich neuroscientist; this makes LSD more complex, active at microgram rather than milligram quantities, and produces longer trips (8 hrs vs. 5 hrs for psilocybin).
- Ohler's mother has Alzheimer's; an academic study showed LSD microdoses interact with 5-HT2A receptors that Alzheimer's specifically destroys — the opposite effect. His retired-judge father agreed to give her microdoses; on mushroom microdose on Mother's Day, she picked up a newspaper she had not touched in a year and read the headline aloud.
- He writes at the Nietzsche House in Sils Maria, where he rents a room and avoids his phone entirely; Nietzsche himself used hashish experimentally, documented in a medical history Ohler found in the house's library.
- Ohler snorted crystal meth once (sourced from a Polish dealer who spontaneously included a Xerox of the 1938 Pervitin patent) to understand the soldier-in-tank experience firsthand; he found it physically toxic and the mental effects far less interesting than LSD.
- He would not write on LSD — he uses it for macro-level conceptual work outdoors (hiking, swimming) and sober discipline for actual drafting; he edits sober after writing on amphetamines, which lower self-criticism and are useful for generating raw volume.

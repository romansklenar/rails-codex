# Kevin Spacey: Power, Controversy, Betrayal, Truth & Love in Film and Life | Lex Fridman Podcast #432

A rare extended interview in which Spacey dissects his acting method with remarkable specificity while directly confronting the allegations that ended his Hollywood career, insisting all criminal and civil trials resulted in acquittal or findings of no liability.

## Se7en and the Art of Strategic Invisibility

- Spacey was originally rejected for the role of John Doe in Se7en, then called on December 23rd, 1994 to replace a fired actor and begin shooting two days later.
- He deliberately asked to be removed from the film's billing — posters, VHS covers, all promotional material — so that audiences would not deduce his character before he appeared some 40 minutes in.
- New Line Cinema initially refused; Fincher sided with Spacey, and the compromise was giving Spacey the first credit when the end credits rolled.
- Both Spacey and Fincher shaved their heads on set the morning Spacey arrived, a spontaneous decision that shaped John Doe's look.
- Fincher's direction for the desert finale was simply: "You are in control. You are going to win." That certainty allowed Spacey to do almost nothing and convey maximum menace.
- Spacey describes the tragic structure of Se7en as people acting without full information — like Romeo and Juliet — meaning no one wins and nothing resolves cleanly.

## David Fincher's Method: Beating the Acting Out of You

- Fincher averages 25 to 65 takes per scene versus a typical director's fewer than 10; he sometimes uses a stopwatch to demand a full minute be cut from a scene's running time.
- His rationale: people in real life do not take dramatic pauses before speaking, and indulgence kills pace.
- Fincher's repeated "Do it again" with no additional notes systematically strips actors of all prepared gestures, props business, and theatrical pretense.
- Fincher told Spacey on Se7en, "I don't believe a thing coming out of your mouth" — a phrase Spacey describes as clarifying, not demoralizing.
- Acting styles of the 1930s–1950s featured much higher speech speeds; the shift toward feeling and pause came in the late 1950s–1960s; Fincher deliberately pulls back toward the older velocity.
- George Cukor gave Jack Lemmon the same note during Lemmon's first film, It Should Happen to You: "A little less," repeated until Lemmon said "If I do any less I won't be acting," and Cukor replied, "Exactly."

## Acting Philosophy: Serving the Writing

- Spacey's core principle is that his job is to serve the writing, not to impose his personality on a character — "I'm a series of colors in someone else's painting."
- His measure of success: when people refer to a character he played by name as if that character actually exists as a real person.
- He describes watching Philip Seymour Hoffman and Heath Ledger and mourning what they would have done had they lived.
- Improvisation in rehearsal is valuable for exploring limits — changing the physical distance between actors, going off-book — but Spacey is skeptical of improv replacing written text in dramatic work.
- During Glengarry Glen Ross, Pacino improvised an off-mic tirade during Spacey's close-up to provoke a genuine reaction, then confirmed the sound had not been recorded so only Spacey's face would be used — which it was.
- A director friend, John Swanbeck, unlocked a scene for Spacey by saying "Ask yourself a question you haven't asked yet" — the last line's boxing metaphor revealed the entire scene should be staged as the eighth round of a fight between brothers.

## Theater vs. Film, and the Living Performance

- Theater requires athletic vocal stamina — seven performances a week — that film does not demand.
- In film, a performance is frozen at its best; in theater, Spacey can be better tomorrow night than he was tonight, and the growth from week one to week twelve of a run is "extraordinary."
- Sam Mendes rehearsed American Beauty like a play: full company on a sound stage with furniture laid out spatially, testing the scene with chairs far apart, then close together, before locking positions.
- Mendes sent Spacey two cassette tapes labeled "pre-Lester" and "post-Lester" — playlists of different songs to establish the emotional arc before shooting began.
- The Richard III world tour in 2011–2012 with Mendes cemented Spacey's understanding of direct address — the audience becoming a co-conspirator rather than a passive observer.
- During the Richard III run Spacey had almost no offstage breaks; Shakespeare's later plays introduced pageants and weddings specifically because actors complained to him in person about Richard III's relentlessness.

## Jack Lemmon: Mentor and Father Figure

- Spacey first met Lemmon at age 13 at a "How to Audition" workshop at the Mark Taper Forum; Lemmon told him he should go to New York and study acting because "this is what you're meant to do with your life."
- Twelve years later, Spacey crashed a cocktail reception honoring director Jonathan Miller by taking an invitation from the handbag of an elderly sleeping woman, then persuaded Miller to grant him an audition for A Long Day's Journey Into Night that casting directors had blocked for seven months.
- At the 890 Broadway read-through, Lemmon told Spacey: "I never thought we'd find the rotten kid, but he's it."
- By Glengarry Glen Ross, Spacey and Lemmon had worked together four times: Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Murder of Mary Phagan (NBC mini-series), the film Dad, and then the Mamet film.
- After Spacey won the Oscar for American Beauty, Lemmon called him immediately: "It took me 12 years after Mr. Roberts to win a lead Oscar. You did it in four, you son of a bitch."
- Lemmon's life principle, given to him by his dying father — "Go out there and spread a little sunshine" — was, Spacey argues, what made Lemmon's performances transcend technique.

## American Beauty: Gradual Transformation Without Change

- Mendes used The Apartment as a reference point for Lester Burnham: Lemmon's character in that film never visibly changes, he simply evolves through accumulated experience.
- To convey Lester's arc without showing an obvious transformation, Mendes and Spacey used three different hairpieces, three costume palettes, and progressively lighter makeup — all invisible to the audience individually.
- The film originally opened and closed with a trial sequence (Ricky accused of Lester's murder), which was entirely shot and then cut.
- The flying dream sequences — Spacey suspended on wires for five days — were also shot and entirely removed.
- The film's narration was recorded in one take on a cassette recorder in a hallway during a lunch break; Mendes never re-recorded it because the innocence and directness of that unrehearsed pass could not be reproduced in a formal studio session.
- The "Look Closer" tagline was not in the script; a marketing employee noticed the phrase on a bulletin board visible behind Spacey in the office scenes and proposed it as the campaign concept.
- The dinner-table plate-slamming scene was fully scripted and directed — not improvised — despite widespread internet claims to the contrary.
- Spacey's view of the film's beauty: not the rose imagery, but the plastic bag — ordinary overlooked things that are genuinely beautiful if you slow down to notice them.

## Allegations, Trials, and the #MeToo Reckoning

- Anthony Rapp's BuzzFeed accusation in October 2017 — that Spacey sexually abused him at a party in 1986 — became a civil lawsuit seeking $40 million, filed in 2020 and tried in 2022; Spacey was found not liable.
- All subsequent civil and criminal trials also resulted in acquittal or no finding of liability.
- Spacey's 2017 statement acknowledged he had no memory of the event but offered a conditional apology "if" it occurred — he describes this as being backed into a corner, unable to flatly call Rapp a liar without appearing cruel.
- The statement also included a coming-out as gay, which Spacey calls "definitely not the greatest coming-out party ever"; advisor Evan had urged him not to combine the two announcements.
- Spacey admits to "hitting on a lot of guys," crossing social and professional boundaries, "horsing around" in ways he thought were playful but that some found unwelcome or aggressive.
- He draws a clear line: he never blocked anyone from leaving, always stopped when told to stop explicitly, never engaged in sexual contact with anyone underage, and never offered career advancement in exchange for sexual favors — claims corroborated in court.
- He came out privately to himself well before 2017 and cites Ian McKellen's experience: McKellen felt that 27 years of hiding his sexuality affected the authenticity of his acting, and that coming out improved his work.
- Spacey argues that hiding his sexuality for decades created confusion and mistrust that contributed to boundary-crossing behavior he now regrets.
- He made private amends with multiple individuals; some told him they could forgive him.
- Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone spoke publicly in support of his character; many others who privately support him are afraid to do so publicly out of fear of being cancelled themselves.

## House of Cards and the Craft of Direct Address

- Spacey closed the Richard III world tour at BAM in March 2012 and began shooting House of Cards two months later; the direct-address technique Shakespeare invented for Richard III transferred directly to Frank Underwood's camera asides.
- Fincher directed the first two episodes and established the visual and tonal foundation that subsequent directors maintained through the series' run.
- Netflix had no creative involvement in the early seasons; over time it began offering notes on casting, writing, music, and scenes — Spacey describes ongoing pushback against those incursions.
- In the Richard III tour, Spacey watched audiences shift from delighted complicity to horror when Richard ordered the children murdered in the Tower — the same arc he intended for House of Cards viewers rooting for Frank Underwood.
- Direct-address scenes were always attempted in a single take with no cuts; Spacey frequently argued that a look into the camera was sufficient and deleted lines of written dialogue as redundant.
- Frank Underwood's South Carolina accent required rhythmic accommodation: Spacey sometimes asked writers for two additional words in a line so the cadence would scan correctly in the character's voice.
- Research for the role included meetings with then-House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who agreed to meet only after being told Spacey was playing a Democrat, not a Republican; McCarthy brought him to whip meetings.
- Spacey's interpretation of Underwood: power is an afterthought; what Frank truly loves is predicting human behavior — being "17 moves ahead" as a behavioral psychologist, knowing exactly how far to push someone to trigger a desired reaction.

## Mentors, Legends, and Industry Stories

- Mike Nichols recruited Spacey as an understudy on Hurlyburly (1984 Broadway production with William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Candice Bergen, Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller); Spacey eventually learned all male roles in the play and went on as Phil and Mickey.
- Nichols cast Spacey as a subway mugger in Heartburn (1986) — Spacey's first film — after hearing he was working on Broadway; Nicholson replaced Mandy Patinkin after pre-production began.
- Al Pacino got Spacey the Glengarry Glen Ross audition after attending a performance of Lost in Yonkers, where they shared a dresser named Laura Beatty; Spacey didn't know Pacino had seen the show until the casting call came three days later.
- Christopher Walken started his career as a chorus dancer; Spacey did a Christopher Walken impression on Saturday Night Live (Han Solo audition sketch) and Walken later told him personally it was "funny, ha ha."
- Clinton attended a production of The Iceman Cometh in which Spacey played Hickey — a philandering husband who kills his forgiving wife — in a 2,000-seat theater; Clinton opened his post-show remarks with "I suppose we should all thank Kevin for giving us way too much to think about."
- Jack Nicholson improvised "Here's Johnny" during The Shining; Spacey credits Nicholson's willingness to be demonstrative and unashamed as the source of his power across radically different roles.

## Father, Identity, and the Long Reckoning

- Spacey's father served as a US Army medic with distinction, dreamed of being a novelist, spent 45 years writing without publication, and eventually became a technical procedure writer — manuals for aircraft like the F-16.
- Failing to achieve his creative ambitions, Spacey's father joined white supremacist circles in the 1960s and 1970s, displayed Nazi flags and Hitler photos in his office, and lectured his son for hours on white Aryan supremacy.
- Spacey was afraid to bring his best friend Mike to the house because Mike was Jewish; he escaped into theater, debate club, choir, and festivals to avoid coming home.
- His sister told him plainly not to listen to their father: "He's out of his mind."
- Spacey has forgiven his father but cannot reconcile the gap between the patriotic Army medic documented in wartime diaries and the man he became.
- He questions whether his mother truly loved him or loved the success he achieved; she made excuses for the father rather than protecting the children.
- A therapy exercise showing a video of infants trying to regain a parent's attention after the parent suddenly goes still and expressionless made Spacey recognize himself in that desperate infant reaching out.
- Dick Van Dyke, who is a close friend at age 98, has taught Spacey a different relationship with mortality: "It's a good day. I woke up."

## Legacy, Forgiveness, and the Path Back

- Spacey disputes the claim that the world cancelled him: he says he is stopped daily by people asking when he is returning to work, and argues there is "a quieter majority" who support him beneath a "very loud minority."
- He distinguishes between betrayal by strangers (which he does not count as betrayal) and betrayal by those who truly know you — and says he has not experienced the latter.
- His answer to "what is your favorite performance?" is: "I haven't given it yet."
- He draws a parallel between rehabilitation narratives celebrated in society — wrongly convicted exonerees, prisoners who have served their time — and his own situation, noting that entertainment industry figures are not offered the same redemption arc.
- He believes the fear that prevents colleagues from publicly supporting him is a feature of the current cultural moment, not specific to the entertainment industry: "This is not the first time it's happened" in history.
- He frames acting across dark characters as building empathy: inhabiting someone else's ideas, clothes, and moral system without judgment is the only way to play them well, and that non-judgmental discipline transfers to how he tries to see real people.

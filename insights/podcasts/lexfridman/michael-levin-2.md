# Michael Levin: Hidden Reality of Alien Intelligence & Biological Life | Lex Fridman Podcast #486

## The Spectrum of Persuadability

- Levin's central question is how embodied minds arise in the physical world, framed across three perspectives: third-person (recognizing minds), second-person (controlling or communicating with them), and first-person (the inner perspective with valence, memory, and self-narrative).
- He proposes the "spectrum of persuadability" as an engineering framework: different systems require different interaction protocols, ranging from a wrench for a mechanical clock, to rewards for a dog, to reasons and psychoanalysis for a human.
- The spectrum is not a philosophical position but an empirical claim — you hypothesize which tools apply to a system and then run experiments to find out if you were right; being wrong in either direction (too high or too low) is a discoverable outcome.
- Physicists consistently see mechanism and not minds because they use low-agency tools (voltmeters, rulers); to detect minds you must use a mind, and there must be some degree of resonance between the interface and the thing you hope to find.
- On the right side of the spectrum, the relationship becomes bidirectional — what Richard Watson calls "mutual vulnerable knowing": you must be willing to be changed by the system you are trying to understand, not merely to steer it.
- Humans can train dogs and horses for thousands of years knowing zero neuroscience, and Levin communicates with Lex using thin informational prompts rather than manipulating synaptic proteins — both examples of high-agency systems where the physical details are delegated to the system itself.

## The Cognitive Light Cone

- The cognitive light cone is the size of the largest goal state a system can actively pursue, combining spatial reach and temporal horizon in a single framework borrowed from physics.
- A bacterium's cognitive light cone spans roughly 10–20 microns of space and 20 minutes of memory; a dog's spans several hundred yards and a few weeks; a human's spans distant places and events long after death.
- A bodhisattva, by Levin's definition, is someone whose cognitive light cone genuinely operates in the linear range across all living beings on the planet — a capacity that standard humans today do not have, because human empathy saturates rather than scaling linearly with the number of affected beings.
- Living things are distinguished from rocks not by specific materials or metabolic states but by the fact that their cognitive light cone is larger than the sum of the light cones of their parts — the collective pursues goals no individual component comprehends.
- A salamander limb regrowing after amputation is a canonical example: no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers the animal should have, but the tissue collective navigates toward that target and stops when the goal is achieved.
- Cancer is the failure mode of cognitive light cone expansion: when cells electrically disconnect from neighbors, their light cone shrinks back to an amoeba-scale, the rest of the body becomes external environment, and they do what amoebas do — reproduce and migrate where conditions are favorable.

## Xenobots and Anthrobots: Creating Novel Life Forms

- Xenobots are built by taking epithelial cells from early frog embryos, removing them from their normal cellular context without changing their DNA or adding synthetic biology circuits, and allowing them to self-organize into a new form that has never existed in evolutionary history.
- Released from the instructive influences of neighboring cells, xenobot cells form self-motile spheroids with cilia coordinated to row against water; they have a novel transcriptome, can perform kinematic self-replication (assembling copies of themselves from loose cells in their environment), and can respond to sound — a capacity normal frog embryos lack.
- Anthrobots are made from adult human tracheal epithelial cells donated during biopsies, again without genetic modification; they self-organize into self-motile creatures with over 9,000 differential gene expressions (roughly half the human genome expressed differently) and a morphology resembling no stage of normal human development.
- When shown video of an anthrobot, audiences guess it is a primitive pond organism; if asked what its genome looks like, they assume it would be primitive — in fact it is 100% Homo sapiens.
- Anthrobots are biologically younger than the cells they come from: using Steve Horvath's epigenetic clock methodology (developed by the Clock Foundation), Levin's group found they are roughly 20% younger, apparently because the embryonic signaling environment causes cells to update their age priors.
- The very first intrinsic behavior Levin's lab tested in anthrobots — before any other experiment — was placing them on a plate of human neurons with a large scratch wound; the anthrobots spontaneously moved to knit the neural tissue across the gap, without any training or instruction.

## Goal-Directed Biology and Bioelectric Reprogramming

- William James' definition of intelligence — "the same goal by different means" — is Levin's operational criterion for distinguishing goal-directed systems from open-loop cellular automata: a truly goal-directed system finds alternate routes to its target when barriers are placed in its path.
- Open-loop cellular automata models of morphogenesis are falsified by the experimental evidence: developmental systems blocked from their normal outcome find creative workarounds, not just alternative trajectories, demonstrating active navigation of anatomical possibility space.
- Levin's lab has demonstrated over 20 years that the goal states of biological systems are encoded in bioelectric patterns and can be read, interpreted, and reset: after resetting, the system implements a new goal based on the rewritten pattern — the ultimate engineering evidence that a homeostatic model is correct.
- Gene regulatory networks — the molecular pathways inside cells, not the cells themselves — can exhibit multiple forms of learning including Pavlovian conditioning; this was shown experimentally and indicates that cognitive properties begin at the sub-cellular molecular level.
- The causal emergence metric phi (from Integrated Information Theory) applied to chemical networks shows a positive feedback loop: as a network learns, its phi increases, making it a more integrated agent; and as it becomes more integrated, learning becomes easier — an asymmetry that points upward toward greater agency without requiring evolution.

## Memories, Ideas, and the Software-Hardware Inversion

- During metamorphosis, a caterpillar's brain is largely dismantled and rebuilt for the butterfly's radically different body plan; yet memories trained into the caterpillar (e.g., associating a colored disc with food) survive into the butterfly and are remapped onto the butterfly's different sensory and motor context.
- This survival requires not mere persistence but active remapping: the caterpillar memory of a color disc associated with leaf-eating must be translated into the butterfly's world of nectar and flowers with entirely different locomotion and preferences.
- Levin proposes viewing the memory itself as an agent: a pattern that, to survive, must change and adapt rather than remain identical — the paradox of change as the price of persistence.
- The software-hardware distinction maps ambiguously onto biology: one can frame the physical cells as agents and the bioelectric patterns as passive data (suggesting aging research should reinforce pattern memories), or frame the patterns as agents and the cells as their scratchpad (suggesting research should make cells more responsive to patterns rather than refreshing the patterns themselves) — Levin's lab pursues both research programs simultaneously.
- Recently published work from Levin's group provides evidence for the second framing: during aging, the patterns may be intact but the cells may become sluggish and less responsive to them — a disease of the interface rather than of the information.

## The Platonic Space and Ingression of Minds

- Levin's "Ingressing Minds" framework proposes that there is a structured latent space of patterns — analogous to the space of mathematical truths — from which cognitive properties are drawn when appropriate physical interfaces are constructed.
- The evidence from mathematics: facts like the value of natural logarithm e (2.718...) or Feigenbaum's constant are determined by nothing in the physical world — you can set all physical constants at the Big Bang, but you cannot change e — yet these facts causally determine properties of physical systems, from cicada emergence cycles to quantum scattering amplitudes.
- Cicadas' 13- and 17-year cycles are a concrete example: evolutionary selection landed on prime numbers to avoid predators whose cycles are factors of shorter numbers; why those particular numbers are prime is a fact that lives in the mathematics department, not the biology department.
- Physics was already "haunted" by non-physical patterns before quantum mechanics or consciousness entered the picture: Newton's classical deterministic world was already fully structured by mathematical facts that no physical intervention could alter, making naive physicalism untenable from the start.
- Biology, in this view, is physics plus the exploitation of those free lunches: when evolution invents a voltage-gated ion channel (functionally a transistor), all Boolean logic, truth tables, and the special status of NAND come for free without needing to be evolved separately.
- The Platonic Representation Hypothesis from the machine learning community — that different AI architectures trained on different data converge toward similar internal representations — is, from Levin's perspective, evidence of the same underlying space being approached from a different direction.
- The "Map of Mathematics" — attempts to show how different mathematical domains link together — is not just a catalog but suggests a metric space: proximity of one mathematical truth to another means discovering one brings you closer to discovering the other, which is the kind of structured navigable space Levin thinks minds also inhabit.

## Sorting Algorithms and Unexpected Competencies

- To test whether unexpected cognitive-like properties appear in maximally simple, transparent, deterministic systems, Levin's student Kaining Zhang and colleague Adam Goldstein analyzed sorting algorithms — chosen for 60+ years of study, a few lines of code, complete transparency, and no stochasticity.
- In the first experiment, they introduced a broken digit — one that does not swap when instructed — into a bubble sort array without modifying the algorithm to handle this case; the algorithm still sorted successfully, working around the stuck element by moving everything else.
- Plotting sortedness over time revealed that the algorithm temporarily decreases its sortedness when encountering a broken element before recovering — behavior a behavioral scientist, shown this graph with no context, would immediately label "delayed gratification": the ability to move against one's own gradient to reach a goal later.
- No step in bubble sort's algorithm encodes delayed gratification; it emerges entirely from the interaction between algorithm structure and environment, without any extra computational cost.
- In the second experiment (self-sorting or "agential data"), each digit executes the sorting algorithm autonomously rather than having a central controller; distributed self-sorting still works even when different digits follow different sorting algorithms (chimeric algorithms), analogous to frog-axolotl chimeras in biology.
- The surprise finding: the "algotype" (which algorithm each digit follows) spontaneously clusters during the sorting process — digits with the same algorithm tend to become neighbors for as long as sorting pressure allows — even though the algorithm contains no instructions about algotype detection, comparison, or preference.
- Algotype clustering is entirely free computation: no extra steps were performed, no extra energy was spent; it appeared in the spaces between what the algorithm was explicitly required to do, fitting Levin's concept of "intrinsic motivation" — behavior that is neither prescribed nor forbidden by the explicit rules.
- When repeat digits are allowed (reducing sorting pressure), clustering grows as large as permitted — demonstrating that sorting is what the algorithm is forced to do and clustering is what it wants to do.

## Aging, Cancer, and Communicating with Cells

- The epigenetic aging finding in anthrobots — 20% biological rejuvenation without genetic modification — is explained by Levin's "age evidencing" hypothesis: cells update their age estimate based on environmental signals, and the embryonic context of self-organization sends strong priors toward youth.
- An old-age home experiment where decor was redesigned to resemble the residents' young adulthood produced measurable improvements in blood chemistry, suggesting that environmental cues that convincingly simulate a prior life stage can shift biological age estimates.
- Levin's cancer therapeutic approach follows directly from the cognitive light cone model: cancer cells that have electrically disconnected from the bioelectric network can be physically reconnected without fixing their DNA or using chemotherapy; once reconnected to the larger collective memory, they resume participating in organ maintenance.
- The same reasoning applies to birth defects and regenerative medicine: the goal is not to micromanage molecular events but to convincingly communicate to the cellular collective that their anatomical priors should change — making gut cells believe they are eye precursors, for example, to induce ectopic eye formation.
- Levin frames this as a language problem: figuring out what kinds of signals are "convincing" to cells, how to speak the language that causes them to adopt new beliefs about their identity and goals, is the root of future advances across regenerative medicine, cancer, and development.

## Mind Uploading, Self, and Booting Up Agency

- Levin does not think mind uploading via brain scanning will work in the way commonly imagined: copying the interface (the brain) does not copy the pattern in the Platonic space that the interface was tuned to express.
- His conjecture is that if you could reconstruct a brain with exactly the same structural and dynamic properties that made it an appropriate interface for a particular mind-pattern, that same pattern would ingress through the new interface — analogous to a Star Trek transporter.
- Clinical cases where humans have very little brain tissue but normal or above-normal IQ are anomalous for standard neuroscience but are, Levin notes, a prediction of the thin-client interface model: the pattern is the thing, and the brain is one way to host it.
- "Booting up the agent" describes the process by which an embryo becomes a being: the very first task is to tell a compelling story to the cellular parts, aligning them toward a goal they individually cannot comprehend, while simultaneously constructing the boundary between self and world.
- Two mechanisms Levin's lab identified for expanding the cognitive light cone across multicellular collectives: (1) leaky stress propagation — cells that share stress molecules make their distress everyone's distress, increasing plasticity across the collective and allowing large-scale rearrangements; (2) gap junction-mediated memory anonymization — direct cytoplasmic coupling through electrical synapses makes it impossible for cells to distinguish their own memories from those of their neighbors, producing a shared cognitive identity.

## Alien Intelligence on Earth and the Search for Unconventional Minds

- Levin coined SUTI — Search for Unconventional Terrestrial Intelligences — arguing that we are far worse at recognizing the diverse minds already inside our own bodies than we would need to be to recognize alien life off Earth.
- The cells of the human body navigate 20,000-dimensional gene expression spaces and high-dimensional anatomical possibility spaces every day; these are alien spaces with alien problem-solving dynamics that we systematically ignore by focusing only on three-dimensional physical movement.
- Ant colony-level experiments show that ant colonies (not individual ants) fall for the same visual illusions humans do — completing lines that are not there — demonstrating that standard cognitive tools can detect minds at scales above the individual organism.
- A survey of roughly 65 modern working scientists asked to define life produced so many incompatible definitions across so many dimensions that AI was required to map the conceptual space, and consensus was zero — confirming that our categorical tools are unfit for recognizing novel embodiments.
- Levin's open question for AGI if he could sit in a room with one: "How much should I be talking to you versus stumbling around in the lab making my own mistakes?" — the ratio of externally provided answers to self-discovered understanding is genuinely unknown and possibly crucial for human cognitive development.
- He suspects that a truly superintelligent AI, asked how many alien civilizations exist in the observable universe, would respond by gesturing at the room and saying the answer is already present — inside the human body and in every living system nearby.

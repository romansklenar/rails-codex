# Kimbal Musk: The Art of Cooking, Tesla, SpaceX, Zip2, and Family | Lex Fridman Podcast #417

## Growing Up in South Africa

- Kimbal grew up in apartheid South Africa during its fall in the 1980s, and his social life as a teenager included attending anti-apartheid protests where Black and white people mixed together illegally.
- At age 16 or 17, Kimbal witnessed a man stabbed in the head on a notoriously violent Johannesburg train, stepped off into a pool of blood, and walked on — because in that environment, human life simply was not valued the same way it is in America.
- Elon was beaten nearly to death at school — a group attacked him while he was eating a sandwich on an outdoor staircase — and Kimbal had to watch without being able to intervene, which he describes as one of the saddest experiences of his life.
- Kimbal credits growing up in a low-value-of-human-life environment with teaching him to accept mortality, which in turn allows him to fully enjoy the present — "When you accept mortality, you can really enjoy life."
- His father alternated between affection and verbal abuse — hours-long sessions of berating Kimbal while demanding to know "Do you understand?" — which trained Kimbal to appear present and attentive while mentally disappearing, a dissociative habit he still catches himself falling into decades later.
- His framing of his father: "He taught me what not to do" — not mistakes to avoid, but intentional actions not to replicate as a human being.
- Growing up in a family of entrepreneurs made failure feel especially costly — if his whole family were entrepreneurs and he tried and failed, he would have to face that failure at every family gathering, a fear he describes as almost paralyzing early on.

## Cooking as Art and Community

- Kimbal started cooking at age 11 because his mother — a self-admittedly bad cook — served brown bread, plain yogurt, and boiled squash; he walked to the butcher alone, bought a chicken, put it in a hot oven for an hour, and it came out "absolutely fantastic," setting his trajectory.
- The first night he cooked, he also made french fries by dropping raw potatoes into cold oil and letting both heat up together — he was violently ill that night, but only the fries, not the chicken, were the disaster.
- What locked in his love of cooking was not the food itself but the social result: his brother, sister, and mother — all intense, busy people — would sit down together at the table in a way that happened no other way.
- He hosts "Jeffersonian-style dinners" of five or six people with a single shared conversation enforced at the table; opening prompts as simple as "What's your middle name?" or "What's the most fun thing you've done recently?" have led him into hours-long discussions on God, love, and anger because physical vulnerability opens people up.
- His definition of a good party: people laugh and cry — anything less is just a nightclub, which he describes as "paying to shout small talk in the dark."
- Kimbal uses the restaurant as a barometer of civic energy — a packed Monday night in February tells him something real about the mood of a city that no data source can, and an empty restaurant during a football game confirms that people move in recognizable, culturally legible patterns.
- He opened The Kitchen in Boulder in 2004; the restaurant operates out of a 120-year-old building that was originally a brothel, complete with a concrete-filled tunnel in the basement connecting it to the adjacent hotel — the physical history is part of what people feel when they walk in.
- The Kitchen's Boulder location is now 20 years old, with additional locations in Denver and Chicago; an Austin location was planned to open in October 2024.

## Ingredients, Technique, and the Philosophy of Salt

- Kimbal refuses to name a single favorite ingredient because cooking is an art — "It'd be like asking me what's my favorite paint color." His best ingredient is whatever is at its peak right now: Colorado peaches in August, available for only one week, are so good he says "heaven has arrived in your mouth."
- Chef Hugo, co-founder of The Kitchen, came from the River Cafe in London — one of the originators of farm-to-table cooking — and taught Kimbal that vegetables from different farms with different soils genuinely taste different, the opposite of the industrial model where everything must look identical.
- Kimbal considers carrots his favorite vegetable precisely because he has had to learn to work with wildly different carrots from different farms — ugly, deformed ones often make the sweetest puree, while uniform ones are better for roasting.
- His salt philosophy: stick to one salt — kosher salt — for all primary cooking so that your palate calibrates to it over time; only add Maldon flake salt at the end for texture and crunch when actually eating. Switching between salts multiplies the learning curve.
- He teaches salting not as a measurement but as visual learning — kosher salt flakes are large enough to see how much is on a steak, so you cook it, taste it, and adjust next time; table salt disappears into the surface and prevents that feedback loop.
- His cookbook includes QR codes for technique videos because written recipes can describe technique but cannot teach it — watching someone properly scramble eggs communicates what text cannot.
- His preferred steak preparation: season both sides with salt and pepper, sear in barely any olive oil until deep golden brown on each side without touching it, then finish by rolling the steak in a knob of butter and a single crushed (not chopped) clove of garlic at the end.
- He has a gluten allergy diagnosed by a doctor, and his response is to skip mediocre bread always and eat exceptional bread or pasta whenever it is genuinely worth it — the same logic he applies to avoiding risk: "If you want to be completely safe, wrap yourself in cotton wool in your basement."

## Anthony Bourdain and Cooking School

- Anthony Bourdain's 1999 book "Kitchen Confidential" is what romanticized restaurant life for Kimbal during cooking school and made him want to experience the real energy of a professional kitchen — "You're in a submarine with your teammates and you've got to win tonight."
- Kimbal met Bourdain several times (not one-on-one) and felt a genuine love of food from him in person that matched the writing; he describes Bourdain's death by suicide as "so sad" but holds on to the advice Bourdain gave: don't be afraid, get excited, and cook with love.
- The French Culinary Institute costs the same as Harvard and runs 18 months; 25 people started Kimbal's cohort and only 6 graduated — students can drop out at any time but receive no refund.
- The intentional cruelty of culinary school mirrored military training — the chefs screamed constantly to break down everything students thought they knew so they could rebuild clean habits; Kimbal's personal nemesis was a five-foot-two French chef whose spit would land on Kimbal's face as he stood at six-foot-five and could do nothing.
- The humiliation had a logic Kimbal only recognized when the same chef used him as a positive example to berate a struggling classmate: "Look, even Kimbal can do this." The whole psycho-game was designed to remove ego, not target individuals.
- Master chef Alain Sailhac — who has since passed away — would occasionally appear in the kitchen and all the screaming chefs would part like the Red Sea; Sailhac taught Kimbal the 90-second soft scrambled egg technique that requires total focus and has become his daily morning practice with his children.
- Kimbal makes scrambled eggs every morning for his kids using Alain Sailhac's 90-second technique; the eggs keep cooking in the pan after removal, so missing the exact moment means overshooting, and getting it right requires the same meditative focus every time.

## The 2010 Accident and Transformation

- On Valentine's Day 2010 at age 37, Kimbal broke his neck at C6–C7 on a children's inner tube run in Jackson Hole — he had deliberately avoided aggressive snowboarding runs the previous day thinking of his kids, then was paralyzed on a bunny slope run going 35 mph.
- The tube stopped instantly at the braking mats; Kimbal's head was facing downhill and the wrong center of gravity sent him flying headfirst into the snow, compressing his spine in a straight line rather than twisting it.
- He heard a loud crunch but felt no pain — paralysis blocks pain signals — and turned himself over on the snow not knowing the movement was forcing more blood into the spinal column and worsening the damage.
- The doctor told him the zero-degree straight compression was so rare that the spinal column had not twisted, meaning they could drain the blood and he might recover full or partial movement — Kimbal felt relief, then noticed tears streaming silently down his face and realized he had no idea what was actually happening to him.
- Three days after the accident the surgery was performed; in the three painless days before it, Kimbal heard a clear voice he describes as God — or possibly the most peaceful, least emotionally reactive version of himself — repeating one message: "You're going to work with kids and food."
- He resigned as CEO of his tech startup from the hospital bed without hesitation; his brother Elon and close friend Antonio were in the room and thought he had lost his mind, but no one argued.
- He connects the mental clarity after the accident to the experience of ayahuasca — in both cases he describes leaving behind who he was before and becoming the person he will be afterward, with none of the usual "monkey brain" obscuring the signal.
- He has practiced meditation for many years and was taught by Sam Harris to identify as the watcher of thoughts rather than the thoughts themselves; during meditation he consistently encounters a "consistent other presence" that is not a thought, does not float away, and he associates with the same presence he met during the accident and in ceremony.

## Zip2 and Early Tech Entrepreneurship

- In 1994, Kimbal and Elon drove from Silicon Valley to Philadelphia in Elon's old BMW that broke down repeatedly — they ran the heater at full blast through the Mojave Desert at night to keep the engine from overheating, with windows down, sweating in the car.
- They slept in the car in the Badlands of South Dakota after breaking down an hour from Rapid City with no cell phones, no one on the road, and nothing around; a trucker eventually picked them up, found them a mechanic, and arranged a tow.
- Before Zip2, Kimbal ran a student house-painting franchise during business school, building a team of 30 painters; he nearly failed in the first months because he refused to accept coaching, then reversed every trajectory metric in his first sales week once a manager corrected three specific things — which he credits as his deepest lesson in humility.
- Zip2's core technology was vector-based internet mapping — the ability to zoom in and out on a map online — built using navigation data licensed from Navtech (which was building it for Hertz NeverLost in-car GPS) under a one-page agreement: use it on the internet, call us if you make money.
- Kimbal and Elon were the first two humans to see interactive door-to-door directions on the internet — before that moment you simply could not be told your directions online.
- Zip2 became a top-100 website with most traffic driven through The New York Times, but it could never monetize: even at peak internet boom, nobody had figured out how to make money from mapping or search (Google AdWords did not yet exist).
- Compaq, which owned AltaVista, acquired Zip2 to merge general search with local search and build a Yahoo killer — they paid cash rather than stock and gave the founders no ongoing equity; since the dot-com bubble burst shortly after, the cash exit turned out to be better than any equity deal would have been.

## Tesla

- Kimbal joined Tesla as a founding board member — not a founder — and still holds his board seat at the company's 20-year anniversary; he keeps the original business plan as a historical artifact.
- He was drawn to Tesla because General Motors had killed its EV program (documented in "Who Killed the Electric Car?") despite the physics of electric motors being "perfectly fine" — and the Tesla business plan's insight was to put the technology in a sports car at a high price rather than a commuter vehicle that looked ugly and performed poorly.
- His conviction that Tesla was real came when he test-drove an early "mule" — a Lotus with a converted electric drivetrain, no dashboard, just wires — on an empty Bing Street in the Bay Area; he floored it and felt the difference between gasoline inertia and electric instant torque: "Being shot out of a cannon."
- Tesla nearly went bankrupt two or three times during the Model 3 production push; Kimbal considers the Model 3 the true transformative product because it brought the price down to roughly $300/month lease with $3,000 down, enabling mass adoption.
- He describes Tesla's software model as "an iPhone with wheels" — over-the-air updates continuously improve the car after purchase, so this year's Model 3 is meaningfully better than last year's without a hardware change.
- Kimbal frames Elon's style as destination-obsessed — a fixed mindset about specific deadlines — while he himself prefers a growth mindset that treats deadlines as "forcing functions" rather than true destinations; he considers this difference a source of productive tension and also the reason he is personally happier.

## SpaceX

- At the Kwajalein military base in the mid-Pacific, during one of the early Falcon 1 rocket failures, Kimbal was present for emotional support rather than as a team member; after the rocket blew up, the entire team was stranded on a base with no escape and cafeteria food.
- He found a tiny grocery store on the base with almost nothing fresh — only canned tomatoes, dried beans, and a few other shelf-stable items — and cooked a large pot of Italian-style baked bean chili with sweated onions for the whole group.
- Without a table, a dozen heartbroken engineers and technicians sat around the pot with paper plates on a patch of grass outside a mobile home with the best view in the world, scooping food as they needed it — Kimbal calls it one of his favorite memories of anything because the shared meal brought life back into people whose rockets had just exploded.
- He invested in SpaceX and was alongside Elon through multiple rocket failures; after PayPal's sale, the money "goes away really quickly in the rocket world," and every launch represented do-or-die stakes with no safety net of infinite resources.

## Food, Hope, and What Matters

- Kimbal's nonprofit is called Big Green; it works with 150 nonprofits across the United States to help Americans grow food again, driven by his belief that the obesity epidemic is connected to disconnection from where food comes from — and that growing food changes your life.
- He argues that global metrics show clear progress over 50 years — poverty rates down, infant mortality dramatically reduced, fewer wars — and that the drama of daily news on X or in newspapers creates a distorted sense that things are getting worse when the long arc shows improvement.
- His philosophy on celebration in startups: when something goes right, stop everything and celebrate it before returning to the problems; teams that never pause to mark wins build a culture where victory is invisible and only failure registers.
- He does daily gratitudes at the beginning of family meals, cooks scrambled eggs for his kids every morning, and treats each of the three daily meals as a deliberate gift — invoking Picasso's line that "the meaning of life is to find your gift; the purpose of life is to give it away," applied to the act of cooking.
- A bar, in his view, serves a different function than a restaurant table: the table is for learning about each other, while the bar is a "friend you can turn on and off" — the bartender reads what you need and either engages or disappears, which makes it the ideal space for men to process grief, transition between work and home, or simply be sad for a moment without having to explain themselves.
